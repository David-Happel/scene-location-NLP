phoebe sr|phoebe sr|well, yeah, mostly nudes. it combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
phoebe sr|phoebe|ooh, erotiery
phoebe sr|phoebe sr|hey okay well thanks for coming out to see me. i justi just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. yknow
phoebe sr|phoebe|okay.
phoebe sr|phoebe sr|i really dont think its a very good idea, phoebe.
phoebe sr|phoebe|why not
phoebe sr|phoebe sr|well, because youd be giving up a baby, and ii really donti dont know if theres anything i can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. so, umm, picks up a puppy in the box next to the couch.
phoebe sr|phoebe|oh no nono i understand the pain dontdont hurt the puppy.
phoebe sr|phoebe sr|nonono, thethe puppys yours.

phoebe sr|phoebe sr|well, yeah i mean yeah, but only for three days.
phoebe sr|phoebe|why
phoebe sr|phoebe sr|i realise i dont have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, sees that phoebe isnt paying attention and is busy mimicking the puppy. uhh phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, its very important. 
phoebe sr|phoebe|okay.
phoebe sr|phoebe sr|i mean, i know what im talking about. i gave up two babies, and i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. i just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. so, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. phoebe is playing with the puppy again, and not listening i really shouldnt have given you the puppy first.
