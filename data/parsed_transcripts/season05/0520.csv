central perk|monica|man, i would be great in a war i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.
central perk|chandler|before or after you were shot by your own troops
central perk|ross|i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
central perk|chandler|yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
central perk|joey|yeah, hero sandwiches. points at ross who points back.
