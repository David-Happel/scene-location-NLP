monica and chandlers|monica|great well rachel, the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver. there that wasnt about the wedding.
monica and chandlers|ross|look rach ifif you want to go for a ride in the porsche ill be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
central perk|joey|yeah, you got a couple hours opening credits straight up.]
central perk|ross|whew that was a brisk ride
central perk|rachel|take the top down did ya
central perk|ross|only way to fly. rachel laughs.
central perk|rachel|come on ross give me the keys monica does not know what shes talking about i am an excellent driver
central perk|ross|youre fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.
central perk|rachel|well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader. a woman walks by and smiles at rosss hair.
central perk|ross|did you see the look that girl just gave me huh she mustve seen me cruising in the bad boy.
central perk|rachel|i think shes checking out your beehive ross.
central perk|ross|what checks his hair. givegive me a brush.

central perk|ross|no way
central perk|rachel|well no brush
central perk|ross|fine yknow what it doesnt matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.  he goes to the bathroom and after he leaves rachel goes through his coat and grabs the keys along with a 20 bill. the woman from before watches her do this.
monica and chandlers|rachel|to the woman alimony. runs outside. chandler exits from the bathroom.]
monica and chandlers|monica|chandler, we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad.
monica and chandlers|chandler|oh right. umm, maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation.
monica and chandlers|monica|chandler hes your father he should be at the wedding.
monica and chandlers|chandler|i dont even know the man. okay were not the close. i havent seen him in years.
monica and chandlers|monica|well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked
monica and chandlers|chandler|well he doesnt have to know its not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas.
monica and chandlers|phoebe|ooh, i think i wanna trade circles.
monica and chandlers|chandler|trust me, you dont want him there either. okay nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a backless dress.
monica and chandlers|monica|so what as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care.
a street|phoebe|okay, i think i need to do some shopping. gets up and leaves.
a street|rachel|ahhh gets in. ooh, nice suddenly from out of nowhere ross dives onto the hood.
a street|rachel|my god
a street|ross|what do you think youre doing
a street|rachel|just washing the windshield. she turns on the wipers forcing ross off of the hood.
a street|ross|there is no way i am letting you drive this car so why dont you just hand over the keys
a street|rachel|oh.
a street|transcribers note|she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is its a tradition left over from porsches racing history. the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday. in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seatbelts, put the car in gear and start it. the drivers left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24hour race moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seatbelts with his right hand. thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.
a street|ross|no ahahah do not start this car she starts the car. okay okay i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now he looks for the twenty rachel stole and doesnt find it.
a street|rachel|look ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car
a street|ross|with you yeah right
a street|rachel|all right. she starts off.
a street|ross|grabbing the car okay okay okay he gets in, but into the back seat.
a street|rachel|what are you doing get in the front
a street|ross|in the death seat
central perk|rachel|oh my they drive off.
central perk|man|hey guys
