chandler and joeys|joey|yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
chandler and joeys|ross|yeah, but dont you think....
chandler and joeys|chandler|all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. and thats what deathbeds are for.
chandler and joeys|ross|yeah, okay. he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.
