rosss apartment|monica|really im really tired of being your relationship tutor. youre gonna have to figure this one for yourself. all right yknow what if youre too afraid to be in a real relationship, then dont be in one. she walks out. chandler turns to watch her go and then sees ross and joey both with huge grimaces on their faces. and puts on a nametag that says ross, but doesnt quite like it. so he takes it off and puts on one that says dr. geller and he puts the ross one underneath the dr. geller one. then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for howard raging in the apartment across the hall.]

rosss apartment|phoebe|all right, everyone calm down everyone calm down i have something that i would like to say who here likes ross ross is the only one who raises his hand and phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down. of course you dont like him hehe didnt give you any money, he raised his own hand when i asked, who hear likes ross, and hes wearing two nametags he takes one off. iill be honest with you guys, when i first met ross i didnt like him at all but then once i got to know him i saw that hes really sweet and caring and very generous. i mean, all im saying is dont judge ross before you get to know him all right i mean, i like all you guys now, but when i first meet you yknow kurt, i thought, yknow abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid and okay, you guys she turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, whore a couple. to the girl golddigger, to the old guy cradle robbing perv so, i think you all know what i mean.
rosss apartment|phoebe|obviously i didnt think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
monica and rachels|ross|oh wow, yeah see, i did not get that. there.]
