audition room|lennart|you, you gotta be kidding. see, hhe, he cant act. joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression.   producer 1 whispers something 
audition room|lennart|hey iii dont care if hes hot, you know. if you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. joey smiles smugly at this this is a play. no, listen: if you insist on this, i will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear hes gonna think im next door.  joey approaches them

audition room|joey|i really doubt that.  
audition room|lennart|explaining to joey, who nods fervently no, no, no. its that youre not connected with anything in your body. theres no urgency. the scene is a struggle, uhm, its a race. also, what you did was horizontal. dont be afraid to explore the vertical. and dont learn the words. let the words learn you.   joey ponders on this for a while 
backstreet|joey|suggesting couldnt i just sleep with the producer   
backstreet|phoebe|hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight 
backstreet|ross|oh, i cant. ive got a date with that waitress, katy, yeah, i know weve been only going out like twice, but i have a really good feeling about her.  
backstreet|phoebe|oh, i hear divorce bells.   a mugger, his face hidden by a cap, approaches them from behind 
backstreet|mugger|alright. just give me your wallets and there wont be a problem.  
backstreet|ross|taken aback what 
backstreet|mugger|i have a gun it looks like he has a gun under his coat 
backstreet|ross|ook. just relax, phoene, just stay calm. he searches his coat and freaks out. oh my god, i cant find my wallet.   he finally finds the wallet and hands it to the mugger 
backstreet|mugger|alright, lady, now give me your purse 
backstreet|phoebe|no. 
backstreet|ross|still in a highpitched voice what do you mean no i knew youd be my death, phoebe buffay.   a sign of recognition runs across phoebes face 
backstreet|phoebe|lowell, is that you 
backstreet|lowell|phoebe he lifts his cap oh my god 
backstreet|phoebe|simultaneously oh my god   they hug and scream 
backstreet|phoebe|excited im sorry, ross, this is my old friend lowell from the streets. lowell, ross. 
backstreet|lowell|ross, nice to meet you. he stretches his hand out to him  
backstreet|ross|yeah, a real pleasure.

backstreet|lowell|ough, i know, but i quit smoking 
backstreet|phoebe|good for you  
backstreet|lowell|so you look like youre doing really well i guess youre mugging days are behind you 
backstreet|phoebe|ouh she nods 
backstreet|ross|shocked oh my god. phoebe, you used to mug people  
monica and chandlers apartment|phoebe|excuse me, ross, old friends catching up   
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|hey, how did the audition go  
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me. he sits down  
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|what happened 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|well, he said i wasnt urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less. 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|so far so good joey nods 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|entering, carrying a large box honey, im old 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|standing up, walking towards him whats wrong 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|i am so much older than these other interns. i cant compete with them. 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|so youre a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience. 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|yes, but i dont think life experience with these. he opens the box and takes an inline skatelike sneaker out 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|wooooooooow he takes the sneaker its like theyre on fire 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|what are they they sit down again 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|theyre these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i cant do because no selfrespecting adult would ever where these. 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|determined i give you  500 for them 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|what am i supposed to do with these 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|well, first of all, theyre not called sneakers anymore. apparently, theyre called kicks or skids and i think i heard somebody say slorps. he takes a sneaker and here, look: theyve got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity to monica would you help me try to sell these 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers  
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|no, i dont think thats the kinda thing theyre looking for.  
central perk|joey|hey, thatd work on me why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords    
central perk|all|hey, hey 
central perk|ross|hey, youll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged

central perk|phoebe|im sorry i have friends outside the six of us.  
central perk|ross|you wanna know how she knew him he points at phoebe because phoebe used to mug people.  
central perk|monica|shocked seriously 
central perk|phoebe|well, im not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i 
central perk|monica|disapproving phoebe, that is awful 
central perk|phoebe|well, ok, i wasnt rich like you guys, ok, i didnt eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer 
central perk|monica|youre mother killed herself 
central perk|phoebe|she was a drug dealer 
central perk|ross|well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because menacingly i was about to do some serious damage  
central perk|phoebe|laughing okay 
central perk|monica|well, this mustve brought back some really bad memories for you, ross. 
central perk|phoebe|why 
central perk|monica|well, ross was mugged as a kid. 
central perk|phoebe|worried you were 
central perk|ross|yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marcs comics you know, iii was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week  
central perk|monica|coughing wonderwoman 
central perk|ross|anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone he looks at monica  when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: gimme your money, punk

central perk|phoebe|well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marcs comics.  
central perk|monica|yeah 
central perk|phoebe|well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, preteen comic book nerds were my meat.  
central perk|monica|so 
central perk|phoebe|well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said 
central perk|phoebe and monica|geology rocks  
central perk|monica|oh my god

audition room|joey|sure, yeah. i dont have time to say thank you because i really gotta go. he grabs his jacket and limps out of the room 
monica and chandlers apartment|lennart|watching joey leave look at that: still in character, i like it i plant seeds i cant explain.   
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|hey 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|hey

monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|oh, anything yet 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|yes, hows this: theyre so uncomfortable its like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet  at that moment, joey opens the door 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|entering hey 
monica and chandlers apartment|all|hey   joey heads straight for the fridge, takes all the beverage cans and is about to leave the apartment 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|probably wanna know what im doing 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|no, that seems about right. 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a callback, so im drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great 
monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|joey, that was formula. 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|we gotta get more of that. he leaves the apartment 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|sitting on the couch you know what these arent halfbad to rachel you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren. 
monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|okay, first of all, thats stupid and second of all, im not allowed to talk to ralph.  
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|alright he stands wearing the sneakers on i feel youger already   he trips and falls hard on his back

central perk|phoebe|interrupting alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid 
central perk|ross|disbelieving whwhat are you talking about it wasnt a girl. it was this huge dude.

central perk|phoebe|apologetic yeah, and im so, so sorry, ross, im sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, its kinda neat. she smiles at him, but he doesnt understand i mean, well, its just that i ive always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have have a great one  
central perk|ross|its not the best 
central perk|phoebe|i know, im sorry, please forgive me. i dont know what to say

central perk|phoebe|really even more humiliating than 
chandlers new workplace|ross|interrupting hey, lets not do this   he picks up his briefcase and walks out of the door, leaving phoebe behind   
chandlers new workplace|intern| and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other 
chandlers new workplace|boss|ironic thats interesting just one thought: you didnt mention the shoes. whos next chandler raises his hand chander 
chandlers new workplace|chandler|okay he stands up you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. hes about my age 
chandlers new workplace|intern|snorting your age 
chandlers new workplace|chandler|ahuh. so hes rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: not suitable for adults  
chandlers new workplace|boss|chandler, thats great  
chandlers new workplace|chandler|oh, thank you, sir or manwhostwoyearsyoungerthanme he sits down again

central perk|ross|sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. he raises his hands as if being mugged 
central perk|phoebe|i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think youll find very exciting.   she puts a box on her lap, labelled crap from the street  
central perk|ross|faking enthusiasm oh my god, crap from the street she smiles excitedly, but ross just turns back to his newspaper  
central perk|phoebe|look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke. ross looks at her in astonishment anyway, i was looking through it and i found science boy she holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to ross 
central perk|ross|oh my god. he sighs i never thought id see this again. he browses trough the pages its all here. what made you save it all these years  
central perk|phoebe|i cant say, i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day.
