monicas apartment continued|monica|yeah. mine too.
monicas apartment continued|chandler|mine was a humdinger  
monicas apartment continued|ross|annoyed okay... i mean, dont i deserve anything i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug joey gives ross a hug not from you joey lets go
monicas apartment continued|phoebe|ross, if youre this upset, you should go and talk to her.
monicas apartment continued|monica|and say what you owe me a goodbye, i mean, hes got more pride than that.
monicas apartment continued|ross|the hell i do ross takes big steps leaving for joey and rachels apartment, where rachel is going through her papers.
