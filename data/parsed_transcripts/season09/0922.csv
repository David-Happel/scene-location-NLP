central perk|monica|oh, i so cant believe this my uterus is an inhospitable environment i was trying so hard to be a good hostess
central perk|chandler|oh, i cant believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places
central perk|doctor connelly|entering hi there.
central perk|chandler|hi.
central perk|monica|hi.
central perk|doctor connelly|im sorry there wasnt better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options.
central perk|monica|ok.
central perk|doctor connelly|above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means arent great, you never know so, keep having sex on a regular basis.
central perk|chandler|oh, damn it dr. connelly glares at chandler
central perk|monica|dont worry, after a while hell tune it out.
central perk|doctor connelly|ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
central perk|monica|long pause ok.
central perk|doctor connelly|and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
central perk|chandler|is that a hint because we love you doctor connelly but we dont think wed want you to be our child dr. connelly glares at him wow, talking about an inhospitable environment
central perk|rachel|hi ok, youre ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping
central perk|charlie|oh, yeah lets do it
central perk|joey|to charlie alright, have a good time. they kiss
central perk|rachel|not gonna find any clothes in there

central perk|charlie|umh... kurts baley
central perk|ross|yeah, right what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract he and charlie laugh, then joey starts laughing too without any reason well, why are you laughing
central perk|joey|just... seeing what itd be like to be a paleontologist... its fun, yeah
central perk|charlie|so youre up for keynote speaker whos making the decisions
central perk|ross|professor sherman, yeah. ive a meeting with him today.
central perk|charlie|hes a pretty tough guy to impress.
central perk|ross|yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him.
central perk|rachel|oh... youre not gonna do a magic trick, are ya
central perk|ross|tsz... no he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve.
central perk|chandler|entering hey guys
central perk|ross|wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. ii i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, id love for you guys to come and hear me.

central perk|chandler|not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if youre giving a sperm sample.
central perk|ross|soso what did the doctor say
central perk|chandler|well... theres surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
central perk|joey|so youre ruling out surrogacy
central perk|chandler|yeah.
central perk|joey|so, i dont have to learn what that means
central perk|chandler|aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... were talking about sperm donors.
central perk|joey|enough said, im there for you man. where is she, upstairs
central perk|chandler|stopping joey ahha
central perk|ross|how do you feel about all this

professor shermans office|professor sherman|mmmmm.
professor shermans office|ross|reading from a notepad i mean, weve been accepting leakeys dates as a given, but if theyre off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can  you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. he throws the notepad in the waste bin soso what i am saying is  is is that he picks the notepad back from the waste bin is that the repercussions could be huge i mean, not just in palaeontology, but ifif you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles turns to look at professor sherman, only to discover that he is sleeping
shop|ross|oh, thats not what you want...
