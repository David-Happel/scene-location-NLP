central perk|phoebe|no barry and mindy.
central perk|joey|oh sorry, i hear divorce i immediately go to ross. to rachel whowhos barry and mindy
central perk|rachel|barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend.
central perk|joey|ohhoh, wasnt he cheating on you with her
central perk|rachel|yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
central perk|monica|why did they get divorced
central perk|rachel|well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isnt that sad giggles. god, could you imagine if i actually married him i mean how different would my life be
central perk|ross|i know what you mean, ive always wondered how different my life would be ifif id never gotten divorced.
central perk|phoebe|which time
central perk|ross|the first time no seriously, imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian.
central perk|joey|starts to imagine it i cant. i keep seeing it the good way.
central perk|ross|id bet id still be doing my karatay. thats karate, hes just saying it that way. towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of karatay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical.
central perk|chandler|maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it karatay.
central perk|monica|and what if i was still fat to chandler well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.
central perk|chandler|sure i would
central perk|all|simultaneously oh yeah come on yeah right
central perk|chandler|what, you guys really think that im that shallow
central perk|ross|no, i just think monica was that fat.
central perk|joey|hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives closes his eyes to do so. ohhey, theres carol again
central perk|chandler|what if i had had the guts to quit my job id probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my jobs fun too i mean tomorrow, ii dont have to wear a tie.
central perk|phoebe|what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch
central perk|ross|what
central perk|rachel|merrill lynch
central perk|phoebe|yeah, i had a massage client who worked there andand he said i had a knack for stocks.
central perk|rachel|well why didnt you take the job
central perk|phoebe|because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks, id have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
central perk|ross|hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, wed still hang out opening credits
a newsstand|transcribers note|this is where the opening credits are, but theyre not the usual opening credits. oh no these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. it then goes on to show rachels still a shopaholic and with barry. fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones. then theyre dancing in the fountain. joey entering as dr. drake remoray and meeting a groupie. chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. ross doing some karatay and trying to get carol into bed. and finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. everything from every other episode doesnt apply, for instance, ross and rachel have no history. and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.
