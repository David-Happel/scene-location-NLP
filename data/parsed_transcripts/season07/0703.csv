monica|phoebe|thats what you think.
monica|monica|well, i mean what about friends of your grandmothers wouldnt they have the recipe
monica|phoebe|well, yknow i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse.
monica|monica|what was her name
monica|phoebe|nesele toulouse.

the gym|phoebe|i know you see it is stuff like this which is why looking down youre burning in hell
the gym|chandler|so you understand, id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. yknow, im a littleim a little embarrassed about it.
the gym|mr. geller|i understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your inlaws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer.
the gym|chandler|what did you do when they found out
the gym|mr. geller|they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we  chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. only chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. you see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and chandler didnt seem to wear his. needless to say, everyone is shocked, including chandler.
the mr|chandler|so i guess we wear swimsuits in here ending credits
the mr|rachel|well joey, i hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
the mr|joey|yeah, yeah. hey, why dont you give a pull on that rope points.

the mr|joey|what are you doing
the mr|rachel|ohh, sorry.
the mr|joey|what youdont hold it like that youre lettin all the good stuff fall out. more falls out.
the mr|rachel|ohh whoops.
