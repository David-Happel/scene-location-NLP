central perk|monica|so what happened 
central perk|rachel|my parents happened. all they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. but nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them. but you know what, you know what the good news is i get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
