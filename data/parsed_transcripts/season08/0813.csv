chandler and monicas|chandler|he didnt say anything about that to me. 
chandler and monicas|monica|what did he tell you

chandler and monicas|monica|okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants  to do what you and i did in london with someone. 
chandler and monicas|chandler|but what did he mean by rules 
chandler and monicas|monica|wait a minute he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in 
chandler and monicas|chandler|because he was looking at her differently. 
chandler and monicas|monica|and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules

chandler and monicas|phoebe|from outside the bathroom you guys 
chandler and monicas|monica|just a minute to chandler thats mrs. tribbiani
