joey and rachels|ross|hey that was a practical purchase i needed that car for transportation okay ii have a child
joey and rachels|[flashback to|a street, ross is sitting in his newly purchased mgb. which is one of the better british sports cars ever made. of course, better is a relative term. which reminds me of a joke. why dont the british make computers because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil. anyway, the gang is all staring at his new purchase.]
joey and rachels|ross|how hot do i look in this, huh
joey and rachels|chandler|ross, a sports car wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there

joey and rachels|joey|hey, whats the horsepower on this thing
joey and rachels|ross|giddy i dont know, butbut look how shiny

joey and rachels|ross|hop in. phoebe hops in. get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.  he starts the car and surprisingly in fires right up and comes to a nice idle. both can be rarities with british sports cars with their lovely lucas ignition systems, which tend not to work especially in the rain. anyway, this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper, likewise with the car behind him. hes completely boxed in and cant move more than two inches. he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail.
joey and rachels|ross|damnit shuts the car off.
joey and rachels|phoebe|getting out okay, whos next
