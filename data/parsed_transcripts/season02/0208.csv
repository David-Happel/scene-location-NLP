monica and rachels apartment|ross|i just wanna read something. its your pro list.
monica and rachels apartment|rach|not interested. [rachel closes the drapes over the window, goes into her bedroom and closes the door.]
monica and rachels apartment|ross|[reading his list] ok, ok, number one: the way you cry at game shows. number two:
monica and rachels apartment|how much you love your friends. number three|the way you play with your hair when youre
monica and rachels apartment|nervous. number four|how brave you are for starting your life over. number five: how great you are with ben.  [monica, chandler, joey, and phoebe enter, confused.]
monica and rachels apartment|ross|number six: the way you smell.

monica and rachels apartment|rach|thats what i said.
monica and rachels apartment|chan|look, maybe we should go
monica and rachels apartment|rach|no, you guys, you really dont have to go, were done talking.
monica and rachels apartment|ross|rach, come on, look, i know how you must feel.
monica and rachels apartment|rach|[near tears] no, you dont, ross. imagine the worst things you think about yourself. now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
monica and rachels apartment|ross|no, but, but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
monica and rachels apartment|rach|oh, well, thats, thats mighty big of you, ross. [to the others] i said dont go
monica and rachels apartment|ross|you know what you know what if, things were the other way around, theres nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
monica and rachels apartment|rach|well, then, i guess thats the difference between us. see, id never make a list. [she closes the door in his face. ross walks sullenly back to the couch and sits down. a moment of silence ensues.]
mr|joey|[quietly] i never know how long youre supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know [ross stares blankly at him] maybe a little longer.
mr|mnca|now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. ive indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
mr|rtst|doesnt matter.
mr|mnca|what
mr|rtst|our fda approval didnt come through. something about laboratory rats.
mr|mnca|oh, gosh, im sorry.
mr|rtst|yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. [hands it to her] thank you for all the trouble you went through. um, listen, you didnt eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you
mr|mnca|well, uh, i ate some.
monica and rachels apartment|rtst|oh, some, thats fine. some is fine. some is not a lot. so, it doesnt burn when you pee, does it phone rings
monica and rachels apartment|mnca|hello [ross is at his apartment.]
monica and rachels apartment|ross|hi.
monica and rachels apartment|rach|[to monica] is that him again tell him id come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin me down.

monica and rachels apartment|ross|look, can, can you do something for me
monica and rachels apartment|mnca|sure, what ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to rachel] music [monica turns on the radio.]
monica and rachels apartment|radio|the next ones dedicated to rachel from ross. rachel, he wants you to know hes deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. with or without you plays  [rachel seems touched. she pauses for a moment, then picks up the phone and starts to dial. cut to ross at his apartment.]
mr|radio|uh, weve just gotten a call from rachel, and she told us what ross did. its pretty appalling, and ross, if youre listening, i dont wanna play your song anymore. why dont we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance avery, michelles sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
mr|rtst|hi, thanks for coming in again.
mr|mnca|oh, not at all. i have no morals and i need the cash.
mr|rtst|its like im lookin in a mirror. anyway, theyre called fishtachios. they taste exactly like pistachios, but theyre made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. here, try one. youre not allergic to anything, are you
mr|mnca|cat hair.
