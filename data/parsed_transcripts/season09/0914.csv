joey and rachels apartment|joey|why are they doing this
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|i dont know. theyre so perfect for each other its crazy.
joey and rachels apartment|joey|you know whats crazy these jars. what is it, like two bites in       here
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|i just wish theyd realise they should be together.
joey and rachels apartment|joey|i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured yknow,       thats where things were headed.
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have       more children.
joey and rachels apartment|joey|yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have       kids someones gotta carry on the family name.
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|you know what maybe once they start dating, and they see whats       out there, theyll realise how good they are for each other.
joey and rachels apartment|joey|yeah, because it is slim pickings. i had this date last night: yuck       but we should probably keep it down shes still in the bedroom.
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|so, what are we gonna do are we just gonna go ahead and set them       up with people
joey and rachels apartment|joey|i know that just pushes them further and further apart. 
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|yeah. beat oh, i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel       up on horrible dates, so that theyll realise how good they are together.
joey and rachels apartment|joey|ooh, thats a great plan 
joey and rachels apartment|phoebe|yeah, you know what the best part of it is i get to do my planlaugh. a       maniacal laugh follows. they both start laughing really loudly.
