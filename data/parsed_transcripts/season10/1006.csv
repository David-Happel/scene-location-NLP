central perk|charlie|benji isnt in love with me. i mean, he broke up    with me. and besides, hes a very ethical man.
central perk|ross|really is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of underdog
central perk|charlie|im sure he was just joking, ross.
central perk|ross|if you dont believe me, lets go talk to him, okay    im telling you, he didnt ask me one paleontological question.
