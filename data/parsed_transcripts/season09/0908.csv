monica and chandlers apartment|amy|no, no, then i would get the baby. i mean you know it   would be just like a movie. like at first i wouldnt know what to do with her,   then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then   id get married. 
monica and chandlers apartment|phoebe|thats a great movie. she claps joey nods in agreement
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything   cause you know youd be dead. i was thinking about changing her name. im just
monica and chandlers apartment|  not really a big fan of emily. [transcriber note|im surprised that rachel   and ross didnt say they werent either here]

monica and chandlers apartment|monica|yeah oh my god, im so moved. 
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|i dont believe this, hold on a second. you guys die   and i dont get your baby 
monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|see look amy, were a lot closer to monica and chandler.   we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you dont seem very connected   to the baby.
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|connected i mean.. to what shes.. shes a lump. 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|you know, guys i got to say. this means so much   to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica   and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know ive had my doubts   about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... starts   to cry
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|points to chandler this guy seriously  later in the day.
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|okay its time for dinner. everyone were using   our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
monica and chandlers apartment|ross starts playing with a plate|woah. woah... nearly really drops the   plate and more seriously woah. 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will   not be well recieved. pinches ross arm ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|hey how come my plates less fancy then everyone elses   do you not trust me with a fancy plate 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|no, honey, its. thats a special plate. see   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. 
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|i cant believe i won.
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|its such a slap in the face. im your sister and you   would give your baby to these strangers over me.
monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|monica is ross sister. 
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|no, ross sister was really fat. 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|that was me. 
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that   used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog. 
monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|hey. amy. youve got to stop doing that. amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly,   you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate 
monica and chandlers apartment|monica about to have a heart attack|okay, listen i know youre having a little   bit of a family crisis, but you dont have to take it out on the plates. i   mean, i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this.  monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat   off with a knife
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets   face it you have fun. 
monica and chandlers apartment|amy|okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate   lady dies, then do i get the baby
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|no, if crazy plate lad.. sees monica frustrated   at this comment if monica dies then i would get emma, right ross and rachel pause and ponder this 
monica and chandlers apartment|rachel|well actually...
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|actually what 
monica and chandlers apartment|ross|well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma   would go to my parents.

monica and chandlers apartment|ross looks down|no, that that is not what were saying.
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|yeah hes lying. he looked down.  joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|well what is wrong with me am i .. am i incomptent   because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you
