monica and chandlers apartment|joey|all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only    yourself to blame... chandler turns his back to the tv. joey puts the tape    in the vcr, switches it on and watches whats on the tape... its clearly a    american football match, with the referees whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|why am i hearing cheering
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|well its okay, its like... its just a football game.
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|football just football

monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|its football... its just football... this is great    this is the first time ive ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to    get a beer... chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the tv and a    moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... joeys eyes double in size...    what the... chandler turns around, but joey already took a sprint for chandler,    jumps, and floors chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...    what are you doing
monica and chandlers apartment|joey|you dont wanna see what i just saw at this moment    monica comes home, and sees chandler flat on his back on the floor and joey    pinning him down
ross and rachels apartment|monica|what are you guys doing monica hears the moaning    coming from the tv and looks at it oh my god, is that richard it only takes    a split second for joey to realise, he pulls monica down by her jacket, and    she falls, face down next to chandler. chandler gets up a bit, and joey quickly    covers chandlers eyes with his hand.   table and rachel is trying to make her laugh.]
ross and rachels apartment|rachel|okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please    please laugh for mommy... rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out,    making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers...    no response from emma... not funny huh oh so, is it... only offensive novelty    rap or maybe just, you know, rap in general cause mommy can rap... rachel    tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process. my    name is mommy and im here to say  that all the babies are... oh, i cant    rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i    know that youre not gonna tell anybody... rachels face is telling oh    what am i doing the things i have to go through... and she starts to rap i    like... big butts and i cannot lie...  you other brothers cant deny...  when    a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... emma    starts to laugh yes yes yes yes oohhhhh oh rachel now really gets into    it, and her insecure movements start getting better i like big butts and    i cannot lie...  you other brothers cant deny... oh emma youre laughing    oh you are, you really do like big butts, dont you. oh you beautiful little    weirdo... rachel picks up emma and ross now enters
ross and rachels apartment|ross|hey

mikes parents house|rachel|nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass...   and the angles are there.]
mikes parents house|phoebe|...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly    cat, smelly cat  its not your fault. and thats the end of the song...    i realise that you didnt ask to hear it, but uhm... noone had spoken in seventeen    minutes.
mikes parents house|mike|phoebe writes lots of great songs. wha... what was that    one you sang the other night that everybody just loved
mikes parents house|phoebe|oh, pervert parade

mikes parents house|mike|phoebe you dont have to eat...
mikes parents house|phoebe|no, no, no, i actually its any baby animals: kittens,    fish babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat    running through it... she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds    it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian    thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... clearly not enjoying the meat...    hmmm... yummy everybody seems okay with it, except mike. hes making a hmmmm....    face... then phoebe swallows it hmmm... at first she likes it, but then, in    an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. you    hear a door slamming.
monica and chandlers|mike|so... what do you think looks at his parents, which    look in disgust   are behind the couch.]
monica and chandlers|monica|so you stole that tape from richards apartment
monica and chandlers|chandler|whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn    star
monica and chandlers|monica|that tape was never meant to be seen by... pauses    joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private.  
monica and chandlers|joey|laughs monica, look... i dont think you and i have    any secrets anymore... monica keeps looking at joey not ready to joke about    it yet, okay, i see you later. joey walks out
monica and chandlers|monica|why in the world would you take this tape and and    why would you watch it
monica and chandlers|chandler|because thats who i am, okay im sure a mature    man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldnt bother him. justd    be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his mens club over brandy and    moustaches.
monica and chandlers|monica|is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache
monica and chandlers|chandler|this is about you and richard. hes clearly not    over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
monica and chandlers|monica|isnt that sad i mean, can you see how pathetic that    is you shouldnt be jealous. you should feel bad for him.
monica and chandlers|chandler|oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y... i can grow a    moustache
monica and chandlers|monica|chandler, this is not our problem. weve got each    other. thats all that matters.
