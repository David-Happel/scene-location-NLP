central perk|rachel|no phoebe you cannot get the phone that way thats not fair okay look, i have an idea. why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone.
central perk|phoebe|or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
central perk|rachel|i dont think so.
central perk|phoebe|handing rachel the phone fine all right, but id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
central perk|rachel|checking the speed dial all right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
central perk|phoebe|ohh, i lost my mom to suicide.
central perk|rachel|okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.

silvercup studios|cecilia|joey, well thank you. that is so sweet. oh, excuse me. she throws her drink on a passing writer.
silvercup studios|the writer|it wasnt my decision
silvercup studios|cecilia|to him im having a conversation here to joey you were saying
silvercup studios|joey|uh yeahyeyeyeyeyellllllook thethethe only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, im really nervous aboutabout being you. yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. yknow help me keep jessica alive. please
silvercup studios|cecilia|all right joey, i will help you. not because ii owe it to this stupid show, but because i owe it to jessica.
silvercup studios|joey|oh thats great oh thank you so much
silvercup studios|cecilia|youre so welcome.
silvercup studios|joey|hey now, ive been watching some tapes, hows this in a british accent. jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again ever

silvercup studios|joey|yeah.
silvercup studios|cecilia|yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent.
central perk|joey|shocked i can do an english accent that babys going on my resume the armchair.]
central perk|chandler|well, i feel like a snack
central perk|monica|do you want some shortbread eh thats scottish like you are.
central perk|chandler|oh no thanks. i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage.
central perk|ross|what
central perk|chandler|well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. makes a few unintelligible noises.
central perk|ross|oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.
central perk|monica|no nono theyre not. theyre still very angry but yknow chandler is also halfswedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for sitting down and being quiet.
central perk|ross|well yeahyeah the scottish history is so much more
central perk|monica|interrupting you can not play bagpipes at the wedding
central perk|ross|how did you know about that
central perk|chandler|we heard you play all the way from your apartment
central perk|ross|were you the ones called the cops
central perk|chandler|thats not really important right now. what is important is while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
central perk|ross|why not
central perk|chandler|because we hate them.
central perk|ross|come on thats not fair i mean you havent even heard me play
central perk|chandler|we have heard you play.
silvercup studios|ross|no, youve heard my practice. okay justjust give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and im not going to tell you what song im gonna play either. but uh, lets just say when its over ill bet there will be a we bit o celebration.
silvercup studios|cecilia|so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. joey is nodding. you try.
silvercup studios|joey|okay he scurries out the set door and reenters, extremely impressed all right
silvercup studios|cecilia|no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room hes not finding it out for the first time so, try it again.
silvercup studios|joey|okay. okay. he goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.
silvercup studios|cecilia|right. hes not angry at the room either. try it again, he owns it he owns the room. it is his. he owns, owns, owns, owns the room he owns it joey gets a snooty look on his face. all right, its a little weird, but its getting better. joey is pleased. oh well, im gonna miss this woman so much. i dont know what im going to do i mean, its been 20 years of my life.
silvercup studios|joey|oh wellheyhey maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. yknow itllitll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. youre so talented.
silvercup studios|cecilia|i am. i am, but i dont know you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy.
silvercup studios|joey|hey thats not true look at uh, look at angela lansbangelina jolie
silvercup studios|cecilia|i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but yknow i just got so comfy here and ohh, i turned down some amazing work
silvercup studios|joey|likelike what
silvercup studios|cecilia|well, lets just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today
silvercup studios|joey|impressed wow
silvercup studios|cecilia|but well now, nows a different time for me. starts to cry.
silvercup studios|joey|oh hey come on, dontdontdont do this umm, look letlet me tell you something, okay now when i watch you do a scene, im thinking, boy, sheshe is a great actress shes not buying it. uh butbut, i am also thinking, she is hot
silvercup studios|cecilia|intrigued you think im hot
silvercup studios|joey|you own the room. she smiles and stares longingly into his eyes. we should probably getget uh
silvercup studios|cecilia|oh yeahyeah, we should get the pause so when jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the mans face. she does so.
silvercup studios|joey|yeahyeah, i noticed that is that cause shes so passionate
silvercup studios|cecilia|no its because that way the camera only sees her she takes her hands off his face. do you wanna try it
silvercup studios|joey|yeah okay. he puts his hands on her face and they kiss.
phoebes apartment|cecilia|that was good, that was really good. but ii think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like she grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch. commercial break for his cell phone. rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and moving into it. phoebe tries to steal some.]
phoebes apartment|rachel|hey hey there is a knock on the door.

joey and rachels|cecilia|what
joey and rachels|joey|they sent me todays script they never send the script
joey and rachels|cecilia|they dont
joey and rachels|joey|well no, im just in a coma. this must mean i have lines realizes what that means. oh
joey and rachels|cecilia|how does it happen
joey and rachels|joey|flipping to the last page ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
joey and rachels|cecilia|ah what jessica hates horses
monica and chandlers|joey|yeah well, im guessing after this shes not going to be crazy about electricity either. hear ross perform his interpretation of celebration by cool and the gang on the bag pipe.]
monica and chandlers|ross|now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
monica and chandlers|rachel|giggles to ross i can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
monica and chandlers|ross|to rachel do you wanna start telling secrets
monica and chandlers|rachel|no
monica and chandlers|ross|stands up now umm, remember im still learning. as he prepares to start, he makes several horrible noises that scares rachel into retreat.
monica and chandlers|ross|one, two, three, four he starts. and well, celebration was never meant to be played on the bagpipe, so even the best bag pipe players in the world would have trouble with that particular song. so of course, for a beginner like ross, it sounds absolutely dreadful. the assembled audience minus phoebe, are horrified. phoebe, immune to bad music, seems to enjoy it.
monica and chandlers|ross|you know the song sing along ross resumes playing, this time accompanied by phoebe screeching out es in tune with ross. while phoebe is singing along, rachel is having a very difficult time keeping a straight face. thankfully, ross gives up after a little while.
monica and chandlers|ross|so 
silvercup studios|monica and chandler|no ross throws the bagpipes down in disgust. celebrating jessicas horrible accident by drinking champagne.]
silvercup studios|dina|loosening the saddle on mothers horse was brilliant fredrick. and the electric fence, inspired.
silvercup studios|fredrick|thank you sweetheart. they clink glasses.
silvercup studios|dina|i cant believe shes really gone. look around you, all of this is ours. they move into kiss but theyre stopped by joey entering with a huge bandage wrapped around his head.
silvercup studios|joey|as jessica i dont think so.

silvercup studios|joey|good luck.
monica and chandlers|cecilia|you too. they kiss and both put their hands on the others face like jessica would do. ending credits hear ross perform his interpretation of celebration by cool and the gang on the bag pipe. yes, i typed that earlier. were seeing this again, only this time ross as already started playing.]
monica and chandlers|ross|you know the song sing along
monica and chandlers|phoebe|eeee eee eee  monica courtney cox and chandler matthew perry are laughing. that then causes lisa and jennifer come out of character and start laughing hysterically. and that finally causes david schwimmer to come out of character and start laughing as well. matthew decides to sing along now as well.
monica and chandlers|matthew perry|eee this causes more laughter.
