chandler and monicas|chandler|because its too delicious.
chandler and monicas|rachel|chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.
chandler and monicas|chandler|nonono it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, reading the label mommas little bakery. pause i feel terrible, im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.

central perk|monica|yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times, okay and if i hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.
