barbados|joey|i dont believe this... have you guys been...
barbados|phoebe|shhh... this is the listening side of the   wall. now joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door,   which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but   still puts his ear against it. we move again to rachels room.
barbados|ross|and then she told me that she and joey had broken up,   and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
barbados|rachel|clearly not listening and still trying to find out   where joey went uhhuh... right... yeah...
barbados|ross|and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the   day i met her.
barbados|rachel|still searching oh, i know... i know its been   really hard for you.
barbados|ross|anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before   you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna   be
barbados|rachel|now looking up at the ceiling that is hard to say,   ross. that is hard to say.
