chandler and monicas apartment|chandler|did you see our bank statement can this be right
chandler and monicas apartment|monica|i know...god. i havent seen my savings take a hit like this since   i was a kid and they came up with doublestuffed oreos. what happened to all   our money
chandler and monicas apartment|chandler|im not sure what they did, but im inclined to blame enron.
chandler and monicas apartment|monica|i guess with you doing the internship, were just spending more than   were bringing in.
chandler and monicas apartment|chandler|maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
chandler and monicas apartment|monica|oh, but youre finally doing something that you love i cant ask   you to give that up. though itd be nice if the thing that you love was yknow...   finding gold.
chandler and monicas apartment|chandler|you know what you know what i think were making too big a deal   out of this. ok so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joeys   refrigerator for a change. youre chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer
chandler and monicas apartment|monica|ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
chandler and monicas apartment|chandler|no were not borrowing money.
chandler and monicas apartment|monica|why not
chandler and monicas apartment|chandler|because we dont do that. we are bings and if theres one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
chandler and monicas apartment|monica|wow i had no idea you had this much pride.
phoebes apartment|chandler|thats right i do and im your man. and im going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. opening credits   a movie on television.]
