central perk|monica|but what if it is better than ours should we at least look
central perk|chandler|what do you think pheebs
central perk|phoebe|well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin    robbins... anyway... hey, isnt joeys agent estelle leonard
central perk|chandler|yeah.
central perk|phoebe|she died.
central perk|chandler|youre kidding
central perk|monica|thats terrible

central perk|chandler|oh yeah 
central perk|phoebe|yeah, she was just an agent.
central perk|monica|joeys gonna be so upset. 
central perk|chandler|i know. he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    atlantic.
central perk|phoebe|well, we cannot tell joey about this. hes already flipping out about    everything thats changing. this will push him over the edge.
central perk|monica|seriously, you dont think we should tell him
central perk|phoebe|well, not for a little while. lets just give him a few days to get    used to everything else.
central perk|monica|what if he reads it in the paper

ralph lauren|mr zelner|uh... what can i do for you
ralph lauren|ross|uhm, well... im here to see if youll give rachel her job back.
ralph lauren|mr zelner|ah, did she ask you to come here and do this
ralph lauren|ross|oh, no. at first i have to get you to agree. then well    see if she wants to come back.
ralph lauren|mr zelner|wow, that is tempting. 
ralph lauren|ross|look, she loved her job here. and lets face 
ralph lauren|  it|youre not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. isnt that    true
ralph lauren|mr zelner|she is good
ralph lauren|ross|surprised huh, i took a shot there.
ralph lauren|mr zelner|but im sorry. theres nothing i can do... ah,    its not true, there is... nothing i want to do.
ralph lauren|ross|i see... thanks very much. he gets up and walks to the door. on his    way out he looks at the photographs mr zelner has near his door. he picks one    up. is this your son 
ralph lauren|mr zelner|yeah, his name is ross. ross looks very surprised what
ralph lauren|ross|oh, nothing, its just, its close to ron. does he.. does    little ross like dinosaurs by any chance 
ralph lauren|mr zelner|yeah, theyre all he talks about, why
ralph lauren|ross|how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.    mr. zellner looks shocked. i just heard it as you must have heard it and thats    not good. let me start again. im a paleontologist, youll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils
ralph lauren|mr zelner|you can really arrange that
ralph lauren|ross|you let rachel come back, and its done. 
ralph lauren|mr zelner|well, i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing    in the world.
ralph lauren|ross|yeah yes thank you this is great. thank you so much. and i swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life.
ralph lauren|mr zelner|thats great. i worry about little ross. hes always    reading, hes collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs.

joeys apartment|joey|i dont know. shes got to be taking it hard, i was like    her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and im guessing    he eats more money than he makes. look, i know shes not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. im gonna call her and hire her again.
joeys apartment|phoebe|no, no, no dont call her you wait for her to call    you joey considers it

the house monica and chandler are viewing|joey|i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason. phoebe stops    herself from laughing and leaves    down the stairs.]
the house monica and chandler are viewing|janice|what a small world
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|and yet i never run into beyonce
the house monica and chandler are viewing|realtor|you two know each other
the house monica and chandler are viewing|janice|oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man    out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin does her irritating    laugh. so are you guys thinking of getting this house too ooh are we gonna    have a bidding war id better warn you, im a toughie playfully punches chandler,    who tries to get away from her
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|at janices punching dont, dont looks disgusted
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|no, actually, were buying the house next door. janice gasps
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|to monica and with bulging eyes why
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|looks confused and scared i dont know    why.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|janice|ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence.    but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ah now we have to    get it chandler and monica are utterly shocked ellen, were going to talk    numbers. grabs ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside 
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|this can not be happening
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.    maybe the janices wont get it maybe the other couple will.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the hitlers.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|thinks a little more okay, okay, clapping her hands    all right. what if we got both houses huh we can turn this house    into a guest house.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|that is a great idea and by the way, i dont mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|okay, you come up with an idea.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house. we can still get out.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|but we love our house.
the house monica and chandler are viewing|chandler|will we love it so much with her next door and shes gonna be louder    out here too. just the crickets and apes janices voice oh my god  
the house monica and chandler are viewing|monica|okay, but if we dont get this house, shes stil gonna show up wherever    we go i mean, at least if shes here, it eliminates the element of suprise.    i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body. she shows this with her index finger, mimicking    it pushing something up
mr|chandler|looks afraid, but at the same time, knows shes right well, we    have to do something. we cant have her living next door. janices laughs loudly    outside oh, that does it too. motions with his index finger like monica did 
mr|r zelner|who is it
mr|ross|enters its me. ron. mr. zellner looks annoyed    look, i um, i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back.

mr|ross|just hear me out. how would you feel about offering her a raise looks    hopeful
