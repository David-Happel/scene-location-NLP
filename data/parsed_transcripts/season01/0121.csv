central perk|ross|she says marcels humping things not a phase. apparently hes reached sexual maturity.
central perk|joey|to chandler hey he beat ya.
central perk|ross|she says as time goes on, hes gonna start getting agressive and violent.
central perk|chandler|so what does this mean

central perk|joey|isnt there any way you can keep him
central perk|ross|no, no. the vet says unless hes in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin, hes just gonna get vicious. ive just gotta get him into a zoo.
central perk|joey|how do you get a monkey into a zoo
central perk|chandler|i know that one ...no, thats popes into a volkswagen.
central perk|ross|well, were applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, yknow, like, uh, san diego... right but that might just be a pipe dream, because, yknow, hes out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so thats a possibility.
central perk|chandler|yeah, but thats like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, its a total party zoo. phoebe, monica, and rachel enters.
central perk|phoebe|hey. we found her, we found the girl.
central perk|chandler|what
central perk|joey|did you call the cops
central perk|rachel|nope. we took her to lunch.
central perk|chandler|ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
central perk|ross|what are you insane this woman stole from you. she stole. shes a stealer.
central perk|monica|yknow what after youre with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
central perk|ross|yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
central perk|chandler|...take off their hats
monica and rachels|phoebe|popes in a volkswagen ...i love that joke.
monica and rachels|rachel|no way. no way did you do this.
monica and rachels|fake monica|monana was very brave.
monica and rachels|monica|it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor
monica and rachels|fake monica|so once they caught on to the fact that were, yknow, short and have breasts...
monica and rachels|monica|...they threw us out i was thrown out of a hotel me
monica and rachels|rachel|go monana well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i dont know. dont wait up. exits
monica and rachels|fake monica|oh, by the way, tomorrow were auditioning for a broadway show.
monica and rachels|monica|scuse me
monica and rachels|fake monica|theres an open call for cats. im thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say
monica and rachels|monica|nononononono. think who youre dealing with here. i mean, im not like you. ii cant even stand in front of a tap class.
monica and rachels|fake monica|well, thats just probably cause of your amish background.
monica and rachels|monica|what
monica and rachels|fake monica|well, youre pennsylvania dutch, right
monica and rachels|monica|right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned.
monica and rachels|fake monica|ii used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets society
monica and rachels|monica|uhhuh.
monica and rachels|fake monica|i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he cant be in the play what was that its like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, now, thats two hours of my life that im never getting back. and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.
monica and rachels|monica|wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire.
monica and rachels|ross|reading letters oh god. to marcel we didnt get into scranton. to the others that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see i dont know who this is harder on, me or him.
monica and rachels|phoebe|id say that chairs taking the brunt.
monica and rachels|ross|marcel marcel marcel, no good boy. see, how can nobody want him
monica and rachels|rachel|oh, somebody will.
monica and rachels|joey|entering you know there already is a joseph stalin
monica and rachels|chandler|youre kidding.
monica and rachels|joey|apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. youd think you wouldve known that
monica and rachels|chandler|yknow, youd think i wouldve.
monica and rachels|joey|phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be
central perk|phoebe|...flame boy.
central perk|ross|where exactly is your zoo
central perk|dr. baldhara|well, its technically not a zoo per se, its more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel
central perk|ross|yes.
central perk|dr. baldhara|does he, uh, fight with other animals
central perk|ross|nono, hes, hes very docile.
central perk|dr. baldhara|even if he were... cornered
central perk|ross|well i, i dont know. why
central perk|dr. baldhara|uh, how is he at handling small objects
central perk|ross|he can hold a banana, if thats whatcha mean...
central perk|dr. baldhara|how about a hammer, or a small blade
central perk|ross|why why why would he need a blade
central perk|dr. baldhara|well, if hes up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, youve got to give the little guy something. otherwise its just cruel. chandler and joey burst in, with marcel
central perk|chandler and joey|he he he got in, he he got in to san diego.
central perk|joey|we, we come back from our walk and the the phone was ringing...
central perk|chandler|...hes in.
central perk|ross|hes in oh, did you hear that, marcel san diego. san diego
monica and rachels|dr. baldhara|youre making a big mistake here. i mean, san diegos all well and good, but if you give him to me, ill start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. monica bursts in, obviously drunk.]
