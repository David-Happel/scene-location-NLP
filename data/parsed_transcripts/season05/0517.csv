mr|rachel|looks around for the camera okay. umm, well, first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
mr|mr. zelner|fair enough.
mr|rachel|now youre probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, she puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. rachel then doesnt know where to put her hands. who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and i think thats a big mistake and heres why. i made a huge fool of myself and i came back, that shows courage. when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no. that shows integrity. and, i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. suddenly realizes that she said courage twice. okay umm, now i know i already said courage, but yknow you gotta have courage. and umm, and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, i said no and i was not litigious. by the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. so she didnt want to sue him.  dont worry, i had to look it up too. so there you go, you got, you got counts them off with her fingers courage, you got integrity, you got pause courage again, and not litigious. look mr
mr|mr. zelner|zelner.
