chandler and joeys|monica|yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why 
chandler and joeys|phoebe|well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive. rachel enters
chandler and joeys|monica|hey, rach i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. if you could justrachel grunts and throws her purse at itthrow your purses at it.
chandler and joeys|rachel|bloomingdales eliminated my department. phoebe gasps
chandler and joeys|monica|oh my god, are you out of a job
chandler and joeys|rachel|no, but they stuck me in personal shopping. which is just a huge step down
chandler and joeys|phoebe|personal shopping what is that like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy
chandler and joeys|rachel|uhhuh.
chandler and joeys|phoebe|that sounds great
chandler and joeys|joey|entering hey goes to the fridge.
chandler and joeys|monica|umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. you cant eat are food anymore, thatthat gravy train had ended.
chandler and joeys|joey|holding a turkey leg theres gravy

chandler and joeys|monica|what are you doing
central perk|joey|i think i left a donut up here. are already there.]
central perk|ross|hey
central perk|phoebe|hey
central perk|joey|hey
central perk|phoebe|ooh how was kathys play
central perk|ross|well, kathy gets halfnaked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy.
central perk|chandler|yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me 32 to see it
central perk|phoebe|thats a good idea for a business
central perk|chandler|im totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. yknow itll be like, so wheres your boyfriend, whatshisname, chester and shell go, nonono, its chandler. and hell go, whatever. hahahaha
central perk|joey|to ross thatthat is a good trick.
central perk|chandler|all right, look, look, what am i gonna do
central perk|joey|chandler, look theyre actors. theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them.
central perk|ross|ohoh, alec baldwin and kim basinger.
central perk|joey|tom cruise and nicole kidman. 
central perk|ross|yeah.
central perk|phoebe|hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.
central perk|ross|theyre not a couple
central perk|phoebe|ohokay, i get the game now.
central perk|joey|okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot
central perk|ross|oh yeah
central perk|joey|well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it offstage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
central perk|chandler|really
central perk|joey|look, you guys have been to every play ive ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage
central perk|ross|no.
monica and rachels|joey|noooo are eating breakfast. ross and chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]
