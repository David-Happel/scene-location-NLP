the theatre|ross|oh, fire there, theres a fire fire [he tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesnt work. he runs over to the sink to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. in desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesnt work. he then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. he kicks open the door and we hear monica scream at the top of her lungs.]
