bill and colleens apartment|chandler|i mean, you have a lovely home.
bill and colleens apartment|monica|well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
bill and colleens apartment|colleen|well, actually, i think this might help. she gives monica a big binder thats perfectly in order.
bill and colleens apartment|colleen|its pretty much all the information you need.
bill and colleens apartment|monica|oh my god
bill and colleens apartment|colleen|everything is broken down into categories, and then   crossreferenced, and then colourcoded to correspond with the forms   in the back.
bill and colleens apartment|monica|thank you. to chandler. i think i just had a tiny orgasm.
bill and colleens apartment|bill|i know the process is frustrating, but its so worth it.   adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.

rosss apartment|charlie|oh, you know what this is nothing. my father is a raging   alcoholic. joey and rachel dont know how to respond to that.
rosss apartment|charlie|oh, im sorry, have i made this evening uncomfortable ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas  without any oven   mitts.
rosss apartment|ross|fajitas be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate
rosss apartment|rachel|ross, you dont even have oven mitts on ross laughs.

central perk|frank jr.|huh.
central perk|phoebe|frank jr.jr.
central perk|frank jr.|oh, youd be getting a really good one. i mean, you know,   hes really funny. like, the other day he made up this joke.

central perk|frank jr.|oh, i think youre right. oh, wow. phoebe, i dont think i   can give one of them up. i mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but   theyre my babies.
central perk|phoebe|im sorry, frank. i didnt realise things were so bad. you   know, ill help out more. i can  i can babysit any time you want. you   name the day, and ill be there.
central perk|frank jr.|how about tomorrow

bill and colleens apartment|frank jr. looks at the triplets|look at them aw. i love you so   much. strokes leslies hair, and she moves a little. oh crap, dont   wake up, dont wake up    living room. monica is the only one there.]
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|where are bill and colleen
bill and colleens apartment|monica|theyre in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you   believe how nice they are
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|we have to leave
bill and colleens apartment|monica|why what did you do in the bathroom
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|i didnt get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way,   and he didnt know he was adopted. and theres a slight chance i may   have told him.
bill and colleens apartment|monica|oh my god, wheres my purse no, you know what i can replace   everything in there. get that binder, and lets go bill and colleen enter.
bill and colleens apartment|colleen|hey.
bill and colleens apartment|bill|some little snacks for everybody. oh, you dont have to eat the   sour worms. those are for owen.
bill and colleens apartment|colleen|ill go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we   havent told him hes adopted yet.
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|but kids are so intuitive. dont you think on some level he   already knows owen comes running in.
bill and colleens apartment|owen|im adopted
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|see intuitive
bill and colleens apartment|bill|what where did you hear that
bill and colleens apartment|owen|he told me and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|which technically now you should give back
bill and colleens apartment|colleen|you told him hes adopted
bill and colleens apartment|chandler|im so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the   door. owen doesnt know hes adopted, and he also thinks that santa   is real.
bill and colleens apartment|owen|he isnt
rosss apartment|chandler to monica|we have to get out of here, baby    when ross enters from the kitchen.]
rosss apartment|ross|everyone i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.

central perk|joey|and were okay ross smiles and holds up his hand for a highfive, but he has   forgotten about his burnt hands. he gasps in pain as joey grabs his   hand.  ending credits    with the triplets.]
central perk|monica|hey, phoebs
central perk|phoebe|hey.
central perk|monica|uhm, we just wanna give you a headsup. bill and colleen hate   us.
central perk|chandler|owen didnt know he was adopted, and monica told him.
central perk|monica|what
central perk|phoebe|still, he had to find out sometime.
central perk|chandler|yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets   that you gave birth to them the triplets stare at him.
