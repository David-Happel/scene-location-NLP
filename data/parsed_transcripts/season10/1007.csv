monica and chandlers|laura|well, i must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child    in.
monica and chandlers|monica|oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the    furniture,    because, believe me, you wont find any porn or cigarettes under there
monica and chandlers|laura|oh well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure i have everything    i need    up to here... she starts checking her form. chandler sees movement near the window from       the corner of his eye and when he looks he spots joey climbing up the fire escape    and    onto their balcony. he warns monica silently.
monica and chandlers|monica|pulls laura into the spare room why dont i show you the babys room joey enters through the side window and jogs towards the kitchen holding a    baseball bat

monica and chandlers|monica|to chandler what room should we see next
monica and chandlers|chandler|any room that isnt behind this couch laughs nervously
monica and chandlers|monica|laughs nervously as well, laura looks confused to laura some people    dont    get him, but i think hes really funny she takes laura to their own bedroom. joey gets up and look annoyed
monica and chandlers|joey|quivering with anger i did not care for that
monica and chandlers|chandler|escorting joey to the door you have to get out of here. you slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she cant    see you.

the playground|chandler|hello... have you seen joeys bat    commercial break    rachel comes walking to ross and emma with something between her hands.]
the playground|rachel|ok... i got a spider. there were two, i picked the bigger one.
the playground|ross|nervously ok...
the playground|rachel|ok... and passes the spider to ross who holds it in between his hands
the playground|ross|gasps and speaks at a higher pitch this feels perfectly normal. ok,    get on the swing
the playground|rachel|reluctantly ok... ok... she slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.
the playground|rachel|more confident ok... she slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed...
the playground|rachel|whoo... ok... wow... ok... oh
the playground|ross|see
the playground|rachel|aalright i can do this.
the playground|ross|there you go good for you and you know what, im actually getting used    to this little guy. i dont really even feel him in here anymore.
the playground|rachel|thats because hes on your neck.
the playground|ross|well... realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of    the spider whaa... aaah... aaahhh... ross is now preoccupied with the spider, and forgets that rachel is still    using the swing. while trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of    rachel, who bumps into him, throwing him on the ground again.
