a restaurant|monica|i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house
a restaurant|mrs. geller|were sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself.
a restaurant|monica|you bought the beach house when i was 23
a restaurant|mr. geller|which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie.
a restaurant|mrs. geller|we really do feel bad about this though.
a restaurant|mr. geller|we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.

a restaurant|chandler|clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.
a restaurant|monica|i cant believe it that there is no money for my wedding
a restaurant|mrs. geller|we might still have some money, if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet.
a restaurant|mr. geller|it seemed like such a simple idea.
a restaurant|mrs. geller|stupid jack, the word is stupid.
rosss apartment|mr. geller|all right, enough i dont want to hear about it anymore under his breath good luck, chandler. chandler takes another drink. starting his massage. he spreads some lotion in his hands, and doesnt like it.]
