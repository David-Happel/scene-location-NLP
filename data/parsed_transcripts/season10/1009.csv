the adoption agency in ohio|erica|giving you my baby you think id give you my child after this
the adoption agency in ohio|monica|well, you dont have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
the adoption agency in ohio|erica|i dont want to look at your file this is over. she leaves the room, but chandler runs after her. they meet in the hallway.
the adoption agency in ohio|chandler|erica wait
the adoption agency in ohio|erica|ive nothing to say to you. walks a few paces
the adoption agency in ohio|chandler|you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because weve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we dont know how long its gonna be before we can get another chance again.
the adoption agency in ohio|erica|why dont you ask the reverend to pray on it
the adoption agency in ohio|chandler|erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last names bing. my wifes a chef and im in advertising.

the adoption agency in ohio|chandler|but you did like us. and you should. my wifes an incredible woman. shes loving and devoted and caring. and dont tell her i said this but the womans always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i cant give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, ill learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... shes already there. shes a mother... without a baby... please they look at each other. we switch back to monica. chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.
the adoption agency in ohio|chandler|you still want that baby monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to chandler, who is twisting with joy. they hug.
