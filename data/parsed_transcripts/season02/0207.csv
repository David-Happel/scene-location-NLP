chandler and joeys apartment|joey|wow. 
chandler and joeys apartment|phoe|yeah, so i said, ok, relax please, yknow, i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, yknow, its, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, thats fine too. so after a looooot of talking. . . i convinced him. 
chandler and joeys apartment|joey|let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
