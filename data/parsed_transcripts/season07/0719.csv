a casting directors office|joey|wow sure thats great
a casting directors office|the casting director|oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
a casting directors office|joey|yeah yeah sure, just long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
a casting directors office|the casting director|terrific well uh, theres one more thing. uhh, uh its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish. so laughs.
a casting directors office|joey|sowhat
a casting directors office|the casting director|so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what im saying
