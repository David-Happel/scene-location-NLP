monica and rachels|phoebe|nauh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
monica and rachels|chandler|see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing a zone defense.
monica and rachels|monica|what do you mean
monica and rachels|chandler|i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and yknow mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around he degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.
monica and rachels|phoebe|that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
monica and rachels|chandler|okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone. [time lapse, they have set up a little assembly line for diaper changes. phoebe wipes, chandler adds the powder, begrudgingly, and monica puts the diaper on.]

monica and rachels|monica|yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.
monica and rachels|chandler|entering check it out check it out when the babies wake up, they can meet krog he holds up this xenalike warrior action figure.
monica and rachels|monica|chandler, what are you doing that thing can put someones eye out
monica and rachels|chandler|he can do more than that he can destroy the universe
monica and rachels|phoebe|no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts and also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.
monica and rachels|chandler|theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass
monica and rachels|phoebe|what
monica and rachels|chandler|glass, sand, whatever. walks out as monica and phoebe turn to check on the babies again.
monica and rachels|phoebe|oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.
monica and rachels|monica|oh its so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
monica and rachels|phoebe|oh, i can still do that.
monica and rachels|monica|how are you still single
monica and rachels|chandler|entering all right. clears throat i thought about it and maybe youre right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
monica and rachels|monica|good. what made you change your mind
monica and rachels|chandler|i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
monica and rachels|phoebe|how did that happen
monica and rachels|chandler|well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow and it turns out i was wrong. and now its lodged in my throat. mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball. he does it again.
a judges chambers|monica|damnit yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler he does it again.
a judges chambers|judge|okay you two are asking the court for an annulment
a judges chambers|rachel|yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
a judges chambers|judge|so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable.
a judges chambers|ross|fine, im mentally unstable.
a judges chambers|judge|and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user.
a judges chambers|ross|what
a judges chambers|rachel|uh yes, heroin and crack.
a judges chambers|ross|crack isnt even an intravenous drug
a judges chambers|rachel|well, you would know.
a judges chambers|judge|now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
a judges chambers|ross|oh, come on
a judges chambers|rachel|starts to cry ross, please, i found the magazines
a judges chambers|judge|and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin.
a judges chambers|ross|okay, im sorry, this is insane iiim not addicted to heroin, im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything look, ill consummate this marriage right here, right now
a judges chambers|judge|that wont be necessary.
a judges chambers|ross|and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
a judges chambers|rachel|ugh
a judges chambers|judge|now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
a judges chambers|rachel|ross your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago to the stenographer and could you strike consummated like bunnies from the record
a judges chambers|judge|is there, anything in this record that is actually true
a judges chambers|rachel|well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.
a judges chambers|judge|well, based on what i heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment. if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce.
a judges chambers|ross|stands up thats great are you happy now look what you did with your funny, funny form
a judges chambers|rachel|stands up as well what me what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense
a judges chambers|ross|and whatnotices the stenographer is still typingwhat are you typing that for did you hear what she said we dont get the annulment. dont type that what stop typing he goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes rachel out of his way. hey stop typing hes still typing. stop typing stop typing
a judges chambers|rachel|to the judge okay, do you see, do you see what youre keeping me married too
a judges chambers|judge|you need to get out of my chambers.
a judges chambers|rachel|all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one
a judges chambers|ross|yeah
a judges chambers|judge|would you like to spend the night in jail
monica and rachels|rachel|and thank you for your time. they both beat a hasty retreat. commercial break phoebe are watching the babies. i cant describe it, youll have to see it when it comes on in your area.]
monica and rachels|joey|entering wearing nothing but porsche clothes so the porsche guy took his car back.
monica and rachels|chandler|but you found the keys to his clothes
monica and rachels|joey|no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.
monica and rachels|monica|and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes
monica and rachels|joey|of course only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car right
monica and rachels|chandler|that is true.
monica and rachels|phoebe|yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.

monica and rachels|chandler|i think thats gum.
monica and rachels|phoebe|im pretty sure its gun.
monica and rachels|chandler|okay, listen this really hurts. lets go.
the street|phoebe|a real man wouldnt just run to the hospital they dont stop. no what would, what would krog do they ignore her and phoebe is left alone.

[time lapse, the babies are finally asleep. good for phoebe the only problem is, monicas apartment looks like a tornado, a hurricane, a swarm of locusts, fire, brimstone, hail, and giant maneating, radioactive ants have torn the place apart. needless to say, its messy enough to cause monica to die of shock right away. parents with small children know what im talking about.]
monica and rachels|chandler|entering hey
monica and rachels|phoebe|exhausted how do you feel

rosss apartment|ross|so then ififi mean if you think about it, this is all pause. your fault.
rosss apartment|rachel|yeah, dont push it though.
