chandler and joeys erm|monica|i know that theres no hole there, i just really liked that picture. rachel looks at it and then throws it away. she then removes a fourth one, revealing a third hole.
chandler and joeys erm|rachel|oh my god look at this
chandler and joeys erm|monica|okay, but there is a wire back there i mean that switch is connected to something
chandler and joeys erm|rachel|i dont care the wires have come loose in your head

chandler and joeys erm|rachel|and did you
chandler and joeys erm|monica|no. it disappears back there behind that baseboard. for a minute there, i thought it went downstairs. rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.
