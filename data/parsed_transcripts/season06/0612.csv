monica and chandlers|monica|i cant be fair. youre my boyfriend.
monica and chandlers|ross|yeah, but im your brother. were family. thats the most important thing in the world.
monica and chandlers|chandler|to ross dont try to sway her. to monica softly im your only chance to have a baby. okay, lets go.
monica and chandlers|ross|well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme. 
monica and chandlers|monica|okay, chandler, you go first.
monica and chandlers|chandler|okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.
monica and chandlers|monica|oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas
monica and chandlers|chandler|can i finish my story
monica and chandlers|monica|do you want me to pick you
monica and chandlers|ross|see, i would never snap at you like that. chandler motions to monica that hell give her two babies.
monica and chandlers|monica|continue.
monica and chandlers|chandler|so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steves doctors name is doctor muppy. so i said, doctor monkey and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. he slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.
monica and chandlers|ross|are you kidding okay, look. ii studied evolution. remember, evolution monkey into man plus, im a doctor, and i had a monkey. im doctor monkey
monica and chandlers|chandler|im not arguing with that.
monica and chandlers|monica|all right, ive heard enough. ive made my decision. both chandler and ross are eager to hear her decision. 
monica and chandlers|monica|you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world now let it go the joke sucks  monica leaves the room
monica and chandlers|ross|its your joke.
central perk|chandler|is not. and monica can be seen outside, shes lecturing him, and pushes him inside. he then nods to rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then monica makes a grand enterance.]
central perk|monica|hi, chandler. there you are.
central perk|chandler|hi, oh hi.
central perk|monica|hey, its phoebe and rachel. um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance rachel and phoebe exchange looks.
central perk|chandler|starts to recite a rehearsed speech monica is a selfsufficient, together lady. pause. being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andhe falters and monica prompts him.generosity of spirit.
central perk|rachel|wow, you know what that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard.
central perk|phoebe|really ive heard better.
central perk|monica|wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.
central perk|chandler|to chandler im out of words. should i just say the whole thing again
central perk|monica|look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler
central perk|chandler|pauses as he struggles with what he has to say youre a little high maintenance.
central perk|monica|ahhh you are on my list.
central perk|chandler|im sorry. youre not easygoing, but youre passionate, and thats good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that. and thats good too. so, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because i like  maintaining you.
central perk|monica|embarrassed to phoebe and rachel i didnt even tell him to say that. they hug. all right youre off my list. 
central perk|chandler|happily im off the list. sits on the couch. 
central perk|monica|sits next to him phoebe, its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend.
