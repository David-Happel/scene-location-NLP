monicas apartment|chandler|thats great. 
monicas apartment|erica|yeah... its almost definitely him. monica and chandler look confused now
monicas apartment|monica|hows that now
monicas apartment|erica|well, there is a chance its another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. 
monicas apartment|chandler|so, what does the other guy do does he go to college too 
monicas apartment|erica|no, hes in prison. more shocked looks from monica and chandler
monicas apartment|monica|was he falsely accused of something they look hopeful
monicas apartment|erica|no... he killed his father with a shovel. monica and chandlers jaws drop but other than that, hes a great guy. 
monicas apartment|chandler|ill bet his dad doesnt think so. time lapse. chandler and monica are in bed now
monicas apartment|monica|are you awake 
monicas apartment|chandler|of course im awake. assume from now on that im always awake he turns the light on
monicas apartment|monica|alright, we dont know that its him. i mean, it could be the football guy. 
monicas apartment|chandler|honey, its us. of course its the shovelkiller.
monicas apartment|monica|alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby no would we treat him any differently
monicas apartment|chandler|id keep an eye on him we have to find out which one the father is. 
monicas apartment|monica|how 
monicas apartment|chandler|i dunno, arent there tests for these things, right
monicas apartment|monica|yeah, but maybe were just overreacting. 
joeys apartment|chandler|pff, easy for you to say, hes a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. hes probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovelwielding arm

the hospital|ross|half amused wait, wait, looks around a little youre mad at me about last night i was just trying to do the right thing.
the hospital|rachel|sarcastically really well, it seems to me if youd done the right thing, i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied
the hospital|ross|acknowledging the last part of her sentence well...
the hospital|rachel|oh stop that 
the hospital|ross|i cant believe this. i was just being a good guy. i treated you with respect and understanding.

the hospital|ross|hey, i was looking out for you.
the hospital|rachel|oh, really, well ross, you know what i am a big girl. i dont need someone telling me what is best for me.
the hospital|ross|i gotta say, i have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
the hospital|rachel|oh, really, really well, it wasnt very good for me either. she turns to leave and ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms
the hospital|ross|hey you know what you know what to avoid this little thing in the future, lets just say, you and me, never having sex again.
the hospital|rachel|what
monica and chandlers apartment|ross|thats right, sex is off the table. the door starts to open behind him and dr. green emerges i am never having sex with you again. rachel stays quiet and after a few moments ross realizes what has happened. he turns abruptly dr. green, are you feeling better rachels dad glares at him with a deadly look 
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|hey how was lunch
monica and chandlers apartment|erica|to chandler we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob monica smiles at chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife
monica and chandlers apartment|chandler|struggling oh, really
