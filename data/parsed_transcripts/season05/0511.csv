central perk|starts to show joey the chords. transcribers note|for this one youll have to use your imagination, cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. so if you want to see them, youll have to wait for this episode to come to a tv near you. holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name. so then, this is bear claw. okay, umm, turkey leg and old lady. joey tries to imitate them.
monica and rachels|chandler|what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. yknow some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.
monica and rachels|phoebe|hey everybody, rachel was so good today. she didnt gossip at all.

monica and rachels|monica|i like them a lot.
monica and rachels|chandler|thats not what i had in mind see, people like ross dont generally wear these types of pants. you see, theyre very tight. motions to rosss buttock. maybe theres something in that area. they all speak at once in general approval of his pants selection joey asks where he got them. i cant pick out the rest of it.
monica and rachels|ross|oh see, ii needed a new thing for today and theres this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, wow, to chandler i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before. no one says anything.
monica and rachels|chandler|oh come on storms out.
monica and rachels|ross|after hes left okay, seriously, what do you think
monica and rachels|joey|you look like a freak.

monica and rachels|ross|what, to blind my child

elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|joey|well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. does a chord and monica starts taking pictures of him and phoebe. they both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that monica takes. sitting on the couch watching a movie. ross is obviously hot.]
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|ross|talking to himself my god these pants are burning up hes still wearing the leather pants. she snuggles closer. oh come on, she wants to snuggle now what is she trying to kill me its like a volcano in here out loud. are you hot 
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|elizabeth hornswoggle|no.
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|ross|okay, it must just be me then. he shifts on the couch and a ripping sound emanates from his lower regions, the sound reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. in other words, it sounds like he farted. she has a look of horrific wonderment, wondering did he just fart
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|ross|that was just the pants on the couch. umm, hey, do you, do you mind if i use your bathroom
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|elizabeth|no, go ahead.
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|ross|thanks. gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. without another word he heads into her bathroom. [cut to elizabeth hornswoggles bathroom, ross frantically pulls his shirt out and drops his pants. he exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his legs. he sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. he next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesnt work the way he wants it to. so he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. he jumps up and hops to the sink. he turns on the water and starts to splash some on his legs, cooling them further.]
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|ross|in ecstasy ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|elizabeth|yelling from outside hey, my favorite part is coming up
elizabeth hornswoggles apartment ross is there on his date with her|ross|kay he goes to pull up his pants, but cant seem to get them past his knees. he frantically tries to pull them up to no avail. panic sets in.
monica and rachels|ross|oh my god

chandler|ross|yeah, okay, hold on he puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. it doesnt work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it. almost in tears. theyre not coming on man.
chandler|joey|umm, do you see anyoh, vaseline 
chandler|ross|ohh, ii see lotion, i have lotion will that work
chandler|joey|yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
chandler|ross|hold on. ross proceeds to apply copious amounts of the lotion on his legs. he literally starts spraying the back of his legs with the lotion, and as he applies some to his butt he makes a happy face like he enjoyed that sensation. after using about half the bottle he again tries to pull up his pants, but at the first sign of resistance, his hand slips off of the pants and hits him in the forehead.
chandler|joey|ross you okay
chandler|ross|theyre still, theyre still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste
chandler|joey|really uhh, what color is it

chandler|rachel|i know, i know i just cant keep this one in, so i pick up the phone joey in a childish attempt to not hear what rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that joeys not gonna listen, and as she exits chandler walks in and sees joey in his current state.
chandler|joey|im not listening to you chandler seeing that joey has his eyes closed sneaks over and picks up the chicken. the chicken starts flapping its wings in protest as chandler holds the chicken inches from joeys face. joey stops yelling and upon opening his eyes sees the chicken, screams, and falls to the ground in horror.
chandler|[scene|elizabeths apartment elizabeth is inquiring as to the delay in rosss exit from her bathroom.]
chandler|elizabeth|ross, umm, youve been in there for a long time. im starting to get kinda freaked out.
chandler|ross|all right, im coming out. hey, can you turn the lights off.
chandler|elizabeth|no, lets just leave the lights on. ross opens the door and steps into the living room. he has fully removed his pants and holds them wrapped into a ball in front of his crotch. his legs are covered in the powder and lotion paste. he looks terrible.
chandler|elizabeth|oh my god

central perk|phoebe|uhhuh
central perk|joey|wow cool he takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. however, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. phoebe just stares at the guitar.
central perk|joey|sitting back down was the chord at least right
