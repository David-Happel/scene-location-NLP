monica and rachels|the whole party|jumping up surprise ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. the box takes off, then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. ross is not pleased.

a restaurant|mr. geller|oh, well, i, i guess it musta been the day after you were born. we were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. you were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. and you squeezed it, so tight. and thats when i knew. ross is so moved by his fathers charming story, that he stops eating.
a restaurant|mr. geller|so you dont wanna go to williamsburg
a restaurant|ross|no, we can go to williamsburg.
monica and rachels|mr. geller|eat your fish. the tv which is still in the sap mode.]

monica and rachels|rachel|okay, listen, im thinking, why dont we just tell them who we really are i mean, itll be fine, i really think itll be fine.
monica and rachels|monica|it will not be fine. well get in trouble.
monica and rachels|rachel|oh, monica would you stop being such a wuss
monica and rachels|monica|a wuss excuse me for living in the real world, okay back at the couch, dr. mitchell and dr. rosen have concerns of their own.

monica and rachels|dr. rosen|so... they sssstill seem normal.
monica and rachels|dr. mitchell|thats because they are.
monica and rachels|dr. rosen|nervously okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... women we meet at the hospital... it turns into...
monica and rachels|dr. mitchell|willya relax look around. no pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, theyre fine. baring his teeth to clean them with his finger go like this. dr. rosen obeys. meanwhile, back at the sink.
monica and rachels|monica|i said we are not going to do it, okay sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
monica and rachels|rachel|resenting the truth i am not a baby you know what i swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...

monica and rachels|monica|getting angry what
monica and rachels|rachel|every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an openmouthed monica in her wake.
monica and rachels|rachel|hello here we go
monica and rachels|dr. rosen|this is a great place. how long have you lived here
monica and rachels|rachel|as monica thanks ive been here about six years, and rachel moved in a few months ago.
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel yeah... joining the others ..see, i was supposed to get married, but, um, i left the guy at the altar. rachel tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair.
monica and rachels|dr. mitchell|really
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel yeah... yeah, i know its pretty selfish, but haha, hey, thats me. indicating a dish on the table why dont you try the hummus
monica and rachels|dr. rosen|so, monica, what do you do
monica and rachels|rachel|as monica aahh, im a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
monica and rachels|dr. rosen|good for you.
monica and rachels|rachel|as monica yeah it is, mostly because i get to boss people around, which i just love to do.
monica and rachels|dr. rosen|this hummus is great.
monica and rachels|dr. mitchell|god bless the chickpea.
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel suddenly laughing oh, god, i am so spoiled... thats it the doctors dont know what to make of all this.
monica and rachels|rachel|as monica and by the way, have i mentioned that back in high school, i was a cow
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel i used to wet my bed.
monica and rachels|rachel|as monica i use my breasts to get other peoples attention.
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel revealing her anger to point at her best friend we both do that rachel lets her anger show too. hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. the telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. finally both guys jump up, and michael wins.
monica and rachels|dr. mitchell|on the phone monica and rachels apartment. err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... handing it to monica ..ah, rachel, its your dad.
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel hi, dad. no, no, its me. getting up to move further away from rachel lilisten, dad, i cant talk right now, um, but theres something, um... theres something that ive been meaning to tell you... monica glares triumphantly across the room, scaring rachel who also stands up.
monica and rachels|rachel|would you excuse me for a second
monica and rachels|monica|as rachel remember back in freshman year talking fast before rachel can catch her well, billy dreskin and i had sex on your bed. completely undone by monicas verbal destruction, rachel almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned dr. mitchell looks philosophically at dr. rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar. commercial break round the coffee table, playing scrabble. rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation.]
monica and rachels|rachel|on phone daddy... daddy... daddy, why whyyy would i sleep with billy dreskin his father tried to put you out of business rachel turns to monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so dr.green cant hear, while mouthing you are... ...dead monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until shes distracted by marcel as he clambers all over her nice furniture.
monica and rachels|monica|ross, hes got the remote again.
monica and rachels|ross|good. maybe he can switch it back. marcel changes channel to bugs bunny, who is speaking in spanish.
monica and rachels|ross|maybe not. meanwhile, rachel has taken another call, from a nurse shed hoped never to hear from again.
monica and rachels|rachel|hello listens um, yeah, uh, snapping her fingers at ross who takes the remote from marcel, then turns off the tv okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if shes here. all animosity forgotten, rachel holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to her friend, who stands up in concern.
monica and rachels|rachel|its the woman from the hospital admissions office. she says theres a problem with the form. oh, god, oh god...
monica and rachels|rachel and monica|oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do

monica and rachels|rachel|ohhh... slumping in relief okay, you were right. you were right this was just not worth it.
monica and rachels|monica|thank you.
monica and rachels|rachel|okay, let me just change.
monica and rachels|monica|yes. rachel goes to her room.
monica and rachels|joey|entering quietly hey.

monica and rachels|phoebe|trouble
monica and rachels|joey|your sister stood me up the other night.

monica and rachels|ross|well did you try calling her
riffs|joey|ive been trying for two days. when i called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. i cant believe shes blowin me off. phoebe wants to be angry with joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain and disbelief, she knows that it isnt his fault. only has time to set one on the table, when...]
riffs|phoebe|hey. ursula turns in surprise.
riffs|ursula|oh
riffs|phoebe|um you, you got a minute
riffs|ursula|um, yeah, im just... waving dismissively at the concept ..working. ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down. departing customers walk right past the pair. sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman looks most annoyed as ursula sets his meal down in front of her. the girls sit.
riffs|phoebe|so.
riffs|ursula|uhhuh. ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years. phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.
riffs|phoebe|um, oh, i got you a birthday present. ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while phoebe removes a present from her bag.
riffs|ursula|oh, wow you remembered opening it oh its a judy jetson thermos she laughs at the childhood memory. phoebe smiles at being able to make her point.
riffs|phoebe|right, like the kind you...
riffs|ursula|right... oh, i got something for you, too. ursula gets up to fetch a box from her bag by the counter.
riffs|phoebe|howd you know i was coming
riffs|ursula|um, yeah, um, twin thing. ursula puts the box directly into phoebes hand. phoebe brightens.
riffs|phoebe|i cant believe you did this. phoebe opens the box, to find something familiar inside.
riffs|phoebe|i cant believe you... holding up joeys cardigan ..did this. phoebes smile hardens as she packs the cardigan away.
riffs|phoebe|so... whats the deal with umm, you and joey
riffs|ursula|oh, right. he is so great. but thats over. ursula resumes eating her lunch..
riffs|phoebe|does he know
riffs|ursula|who

riffs|ursula|he is why
riffs|phoebe|you got me.
riffs|ursula|right. a waiter comes over for the stolen chicken. ursula turns to him.
riffs|ursula|excuse me. doesnt this come with a side salad the man gives up, shaking his head.
riffs|phoebe|so, um, are you gonna call him
riffs|ursula|what indicating the departing waiter do you think he likes me
riffs|phoebe|no, joey.
riffs|ursula|oh. no, no, he is so smart. hell figure it out. offering to share her food do you want some chicken
riffs|phoebe|no. no food with a face.
riffs|ursula|you have not changed ursulas eyes dance as she laughs and smiles, simply glad to be back with her sister.
the emergency room|phoebe|yeah, you too. trying not to wrinkle her nose, phoebe smiles back realising its down to her to make up for her negligent sister. meanwhile, ursula still hasnt received her side salad, but when she attempts to attract the waiters attention, he ignores her. monica enter, looking worried. as they approach the desk, rachel adopts a winning smile, while monica struggles to smile at all.]
the emergency room|rachel|as monica hi, remember us
the emergency room|nurse|grimacing mmm hmmm.
the emergency room|monica|as rachel um, okay. you just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. well, it turns out we need a whole new one little laugh because uh, you see, ii, i put the wrong name again. little laugh cause um...

the emergency room|rachel|as monica yeah, and and, im just gonna pay for this with a check.
the emergency room|nurse|well, you know your insurance will cover that.
monica and rachels|rachel|as monica yeah, i know... mirroring her friend ..im im just not that bright either. the girls escape with a new form. hes busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help ross. marcel chitters about.]
monica and rachels|chandler|okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father.
monica and rachels|ross|uhhuh.
monica and rachels|chandler|say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this.
monica and rachels|ross|do you have a point
monica and rachels|chandler|you know, you think i would. instead of scampering, marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.
monica and rachels|chandler|whats up with the simian
monica and rachels|ross|its just a fur ball.
monica and rachels|chandler|okay... returning to the board ..whose turn is it
monica and rachels|ross|yours, i just got 43 points for kidney.
monica and rachels|chandler|no, no, you got zero points for idney.
the emergency room|ross|i had a k. wheres wheres my k the unvoiced hissing continues. in alarm, ross and chandler look at the monkey, who is now in some distress. at last. ross and chandler hurtle in. little marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled in rosss arms. they dash up to the admissions desk. ross is frantic.]
the emergency room|ross|youve got to help me my monkey swallowed a k hearing her brothers voice, monica gets up to stand behind chandler, followed by rachel.
the emergency room|nurse|angrily you go get that animal outta here.
the emergency room|ross|no, no you dont understand the animal hospital is way across town hes choking i dont know what else to do.
the emergency room|monica|whats goin on ross and chandler turn at the voice...
the emergency room|chandler|marcel swallowed a scrabble tile.
the emergency room|rachel|oh. ..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and ross and chandler whip around once more. monica and rachel recoil slightly.
the emergency room|nurse|excuse me... this hospital is for people
the emergency room|ross|lady, he is people. he has a name, okay he watches jeopardy he he touches himself when nobodys watching. please, please have a heart rosss vigorous protest is attracting attention.
the emergency room|dr. mitchell|ill take a look at him. rachel, monica, ross and chandler whip around for a second time, in formation.
the emergency room|rachel and monica|oh, thank you.
the emergency room|monica|michael.
the emergency room|dr. mitchell|rachel.
the emergency room|rachel|what
the emergency room|monica|as rachel monica.
the emergency room|rachel|as monica oh.
the emergency room|monica|as rachel hi.
central perk|rachel|as monica hi. monica smiles to cover her embarrassment, but rachel sadly looks away... the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and makeup to match that of her twin sister. she hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching joey who sits next to the main sofa.]
central perk|phoebe|as ursula hey.
central perk|joey|urse... phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.
central perk|joey|..ah, whatre you doing here ive been trying to call you.
central perk|phoebe|as ursula listen, um...

central perk|phoebe|as ursula im sorry.
central perk|joey|i dont get it. what happened what about everything you said under the bridge phoebe is almost thrown by this.
central perk|phoebe|as ursula: yeah, um... nervously clears her throat you know you, you should just forget about what i said under the bridge, i was talkin crazy that night, i was so drunk
central perk|joey|you dont drink.
central perk|phoebe|as ursula thats right, i dont... but i was, i was drunk on you
central perk|joey|oh, urse... he tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.
central perk|phoebe|as ursula okay, yeah, so its not gonna work.
central perk|joey|why is it because im friends with phoebe
central perk|phoebe|as ursula if it was, would you stop hanging out with her
central perk|joey|thinking carefully no. no, i, i couldnt do that.
central perk|phoebe|as ursula um, then yes, its cause of phoebe so, you know, its either her or me.
central perk|joey|then, uh, then im sorry. he sinks to the sofa, saddened by ursulas ultimatum, while phoebe follows, touched by joeys good heart.
central perk|phoebe|as ursula you know... unconsciously putting a hand on his knee youre gonna be really, really hard to get over.
central perk|joey|i know... he looks up at her face and phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. joeys voice becomes soft and warm.
central perk|joey|i dont know whether its just cause were breakin up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
central perk|phoebe|really phoebe smiles, when joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. phoebe silently shouts oh, whoa to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. a thoughtful joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...
central perk|joey|pheebs
the hospital|phoebe|automatically yeah. oooh... shes sprung. anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. ross sits beside him, as a smiling chandler, monica and rachel look on.]
the hospital|ross|he looks so tiny. the door bursts open, and joey and phoebe rush in.
the hospital|joey|we just got the message.
the hospital|phoebe|is he alright
the hospital|ross|yeah. the doctor got the k out. he also found an m and an o.
the hospital|chandler|we think he was trying to spell out monkey. ross does not approve of chandlers daft theory.
the hospital|ross|well, the doctor says hes gonna be fine, hes just sleeping now.
the hospital|chandler|tapping ross on his shoulder so, you feel like a dad yet
the hospital|ross|no, why
the hospital|chandler|hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad. ross does approve of this, but hes still not sure. the tiny figure stirs.
the hospital|monica|oh, look, hes waking up
monica and rachels|ross|quietly hey, fella how you doing all of a sudden, marcel grabs rosss finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that ross finally knows what it is to be a father. he looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, rachel tenderly resting her chin upon monicas shoulder. ross realises that chandler was right and hes gonna make a great dad closing credits of the window and ross is handing out some chinese takeout. theres a small sap in the corner of the screen.]
monica and rachels|ross|aqui est. here it is
