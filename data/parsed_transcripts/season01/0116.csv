chandlers office|mr. douglas|youre kidding she seems so... 
chandlers office|chandler|oh, no, no. nina... miming fairies twinkling around his head ..she is whooo weweewoo whoo whoo in fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. 
chandlers office|mr. douglas|thats unbelievable. 
chandlers office|chandler|and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. 
chandlers office|mr. douglas|i see. i guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. 
lamaze class|chandler|well, i guess thats why they call it psychology, sir. mr. douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what bing has just said, but turning to follow nina down the corridor, he realises bing must be telling the truth, since he would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he carol is cradled in his lap, and she has a pretend baby, on her lap. the teacher is showing her class a video, which is about to end.]

lamaze class|susan|carol, carol, sweetie. cleansing breath. both women gulp in air. ross looks at his football, then manipulates the head  limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents. 
lamaze class|susan|i know its frightening, but, big picture. the birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives. ross is staring blankly into space. 
lamaze class|susan|i mean, thats what this is all about, right ross ross
