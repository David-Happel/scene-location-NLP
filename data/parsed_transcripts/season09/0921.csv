joeys apartment|ross|ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt    monay. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you.
joeys apartment|joey|phonetically looks confused
joeys apartment|ross|yeah, yeah that means... you know we just... we dont have time    for this.
joeys apartment|joey|ok.
joeys apartment|ross|ok, but you know what i gotta say,    im really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly
joeys apartment|joey|ah im an actor i can memorize anything last week on days    i had to say frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.
joeys apartment|ross|wow. what does that mean
joeys apartment|joey|no idea but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i    guess it means youre gonna get eaten by a bear.
joeys apartment|ross|ok so lets move on to the renaissance

phoebe and rachel at the spa|rachel|yah shes... uhm... not very good though... phoebe looks devastated
phoebe and rachel at the spa|phoebe|uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is
phoebe and rachel at the spa|rachel|i dont know... maybe its because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...
phoebe and rachel at the spa|phoebe|or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because youre    such a high maintenance tight ass
phoebe and rachel at the spa|rachel|now lifts her head phoebe
phoebe and rachel at the spa|phoebe|you know its me
phoebe and rachel at the spa|rachel|for like a half an hour man, you can lie about sweden

phoebe and rachel at the spa|phoebe|tips not included.
phoebe and rachel at the spa|rachel|oh phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here
phoebe and rachel at the spa|phoebe|because i was ashamed ok i sold out for the cash and then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know...    you pay a price. now im this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh    paying taxes
phoebe and rachel at the spa|rachel|phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit be true to what you believe in honey, you have principles    and i so admire that i dont have any
phoebe and rachel at the spa|phoebe|you know what you are right. i am gonna quit. its time    i took my life back

central perk|ross|recovers his composure and starts typing respectfully, professor    r. geller. hits return, closes the laptop and joins charlie on the    sofa hey
central perk|charlie|hi
central perk|ross|hey, how was the met
central perk|charlie|the museum was amazing
central perk|ross|yeah joey really knows his art, huh
central perk|charlie|not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didnt even make any sense.
central perk|ross|what do you mean
central perk|charlie|well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around.
central perk|ross|perplexed for a moment wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the met, did you go to the right
central perk|charlie|no, we went to the left.
central perk|ross|shaking head oh joey, joey but still, i mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together.
central perk|charlie|yeah, its fun hesitating.
central perk|ross|what
central perk|charlie|actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you dont really    know me that well it would be weird.
central perk|ross|what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
central perk|charlie|well... im just thinking that maybe hes not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common    with. you know what i mean
central perk|ross|slowly yeah. but you know what i think you should give joey    a chance. i mean, hes a great guy, and sure he doesnt know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
central perk|charlie|yeah, i guess thats true.
central perk|ross|and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you    know, thats the kind of guy joey is.
central perk|charlie|he is very sweet. plus hes hot
central perk|ross|that was going to be my next argument. joey walks in 
central perk|joey|hey
