the animal hospital|chandler|he will, joe.
the animal hospital|joey|yeah, but what if he doesnt hes such a good duck. with that we go into a little flashback about the guys memories of the duck. the first one is joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. then its chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. then we see ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. he takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. then its chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls apartment, joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainmentcenter, then chandler playing hideandgoseek with them, and its concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping its wings. and the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.
the animal hospital|joey|im so worried about him, yknow
the animal hospital|the doctor|coming in from surgery somebody lose a ring
the animal hospital|ross|oh my god thank you thank you so much he grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a doubletake realising where its been.
