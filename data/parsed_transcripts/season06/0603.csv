central perk|ross|oh, that. umm, she took it really well.
central perk|phoebe|you didnt tell her did you
central perk|ross|no. 
central perk|phoebe|of course not, because youre in love with her.
central perk|ross|i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. ii just comforted her, as a friend.
central perk|phoebe|what do you mean, comforted her
central perk|ross|its nothing, i just gave her a hug.
central perk|phoebe|ahha a classic sign of love, the hug
central perk|ross|its also a sign of friendship.
central perk|phoebe|yeah, not in your case lovey loverson. tries to take a bite out of rosss cookie.
central perk|ross|grabs back his cookie it was a hug
central perk|phoebe|okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair
central perk|ross|sssmell her hair what if i did
central perk|phoebe|ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head thats why, thats why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them ross is staring at her dumbfounded. oh come on ross, youre a scientist. 
central perk|ross|i was hugging her as a friend. its not my fault herher hair got in my face, shes got a lot of it and it smells allall uhcoconutty. phoebe raises her eyebrows. what oh, that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts
central perk|phoebe|taking his coffee okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right rachels not in the same place you are.
central perk|ross|grabbing back his coffee if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place
monica and rachels|phoebe|okay, i didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love  she goes for his magazine and he grabs it away before she reaches it. but she was only using the magazine as a decoy because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of the cookie and drinks some of the coffee.
monica and rachels|joey|hey to chandler dude, some guy just called for you.
monica and rachels|chandler|who was it
monica and rachels|joey|i dont know how about, thanks for taking the message. jeez exits.

monica and rachels|chandler|sure
monica and rachels|monica|okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here okay, whatever, i really havent thought about it that much.
monica and rachels|chandler|well, i like that idea. obviously i was thinking maybemaybemaybe it could be a game room, yknow i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for 200, the real ones the bigbig ones

monica and rachels|monica|i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
monica and rachels|chandler|which is why asteroids is perfect its the oldest game
monica and rachels|monica|what do you have against the beautiful guest room
