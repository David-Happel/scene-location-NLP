monica and rachels|joey|ohhh. i thought it was like long island.
monica and rachels|ross|he catches the ball and pauses, staring at joey in disbelief also an island. the game resumes.
monica and rachels|joey|hey, what time is it
monica and rachels|ross|looks at his watch 2:17.
monica and rachels|joey|wow you realize that weve been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour
monica and rachels|ross|are you serious
monica and rachels|joey|yeah. i realized it about a halfhour ago but i didnt want to say anything cause i didnt want to jinx it.
monica and rachels|ross|wow we are pretty good at this hey we totally forgot about lunch
monica and rachels|joey|oh, ii, i think thats the first time i ever missed a meal checks his pants. yeah, my pants are a little loose
monica and rachels|rachel|entering hey, you guys
monica and rachels|joey|hey
monica and rachels|rachel|is monica here 
monica and rachels|joey and ross|no.
monica and rachels|rachel|all right listen umm, i just bought something im not sure shes gonna like it, and its gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl.
monica and rachels|ross|you bought shawn cassidy
monica and rachels|rachel|noo i wish okay, you ready  
monica and rachels|joey and ross|yeah
monica and rachels|rachel|okay she goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, ross stares in shock. check it out joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly buy on the planet. rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. yep, a hairless cat joey and ross start to get sick.
monica and rachels|ross|whatwhat is it
monica and rachels|joey|what the hell is that
monica and rachels|rachel|its a, its a cat
monica and rachels|joey|that, is not a cat i have to agree with joey on this one.
monica and rachels|rachel|yes it is
monica and rachels|ross|why is it inside out
monica and rachels|rachel|excuse me but this is a purebred, showquality sphinx cat
monica and rachels|ross|how much did you pay for that
monica and rachels|rachel|well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.
monica and rachels|ross|yeah how much
monica and rachels|rachel|a thousand bucks.
monica and rachels|ross|on a cat
monica and rachels|joey|its not a cat
monica and rachels|rachel|all right listen ball boys my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
monica and rachels|ross|free cats do that too, yknow. which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably wont die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save its life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.
monica and rachels|joey|its not a cat
monica and rachels|rachel|ugh look you guys, im really excited about this okay i dont care what you think im gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson. they both glare at her. well, what am i gonna call her fluffy rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.
monica and rachels|ross|to joey hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth huh
monica and rachels|joey|uhh, the ball thing.

monica and rachels|joey|okay they throw the ball back and forth once.
monica and rachels|joey|catches the ball uhoh.
monica and rachels|ross|what
monica and rachels|joey|i have to pee. and rachels in the bathroom [cut to chandler and joeys, ross is seen throwing the ball into the bathroom, presumably where joey is currently using the facilities.]
monica and rachels|joey|man, i didnt think we were gonna make it
the 5th precinct|ross|i know looks at the ball in his hands. dont switch hands, okay about commitment. and as hes walking through the door he notices a couple of ladies of the night sitting there. if you know what i mean.]
the 5th precinct|chandler|hey ladies what are you in here for laughs at his joke.

the 5th precinct|gary|listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i justi wanna be around her as much as i can.
the 5th precinct|chandler|wow, yknow when you say it, it doesnt sound so scary.
the 5th precinct|gary|so you know what im talking about, right
the 5th precinct|chandler|yeah, i think i do yknow what you move in with her you move in with her right now maybe i should in with monica
the 5th precinct|gary|no, its too soon for you guys.
chandler and joeys|chandler|pause yeah, youre right about that.
chandler and joeys|ross|now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws how did it get there yknow, sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up. but it wont work. ill always have the last laugh manicallaugh.wav okay, so maybe im a little deluded, its probably just my spellchecker. but, i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt. yay me anyhoo
