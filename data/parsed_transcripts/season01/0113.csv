monica and rachels|ross|ysee, thats where youre wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian
monica and rachels|roger|i dunno. maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
monica and rachels|ross|why why would i why why why why
monica and rachels|roger|i dont know. maybe maybe low selfesteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
monica and rachels|monica|waitwait, go back to that sibling thing.
monica and rachels|roger|well, i dont know. i mean, its conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
monica and rachels|ross|that thats ridiculous i dont feel guilty for her failures
monica and rachels|monica|oh so you think im a failure
monica and rachels|phoebe|isnt he good
monica and rachels|ross|nonono, thatthats not what i was saying...
monica and rachels|monica|yknow, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so theyd keep liking you better
monica and rachels|ross|hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good cut to later. rachel is in tears
monica and rachels|rachel|youre right i mean youre right it wasnt just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in.
