back at the party in 1987|chandler|what did i marry into  commercial break  monica is dancing. at first she seems insecure and moves slowly, but then gets into the groove and swings her hips from side to side while holding her hands up. she then eats the last piece of pizza she was holding and again moves her hips from side to side, pushing her hands in the air in beat with the music. her moves get more wildly while shes snapping her fingers. she loses balance and falls back onto a pink bean bag.
