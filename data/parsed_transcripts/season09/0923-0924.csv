the restaurant|chandler|you know, its very hard to take you seriously when you look like that. david and phoebe sit down at a table close to chandler and monicas
the restaurant|david|uh, phoebe, uh, i have... something i wanna say.
the restaurant|monica|oh my god, hes gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, lets go.
the restaurant|chandler|i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk doing david uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh... spit it out, david
the restaurant|david|uh, phoebe, uh... chandler hits his own head youre an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didnt help
the restaurant|phoebe|sure, ok, yeah.
the restaurant|david|but well, now that were together again, i dont ever want to be apart. so, to that end... david produces the ring. at the same time, mike walks in, behind david
the restaurant|phoebe|oh my god, mike
the restaurant|david|its david, actually
the restaurant|phoebe|no, mikes here.
the restaurant|david|turns around hi mike
the restaurant|mike|hi david. chandler. monica... looks at monica, checking her big hair, aghast oh

the restaurant|mike|hi phoebe.
the restaurant|phoebe|what are you, what are you doing here
the restaurant|mike|i have a question i need to ask you.
the restaurant|david|i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself.
the restaurant|mike|yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
the restaurant|david|annoyed ok, would you care for my seat as well
the restaurant|mike|actually yeah, thatll be great.
the restaurant|david|thats fair, youve had a long trip. he leaves his seat to mike, and stands there looking for a chair. he finally goes to monica and chandlers table
the restaurant|mike|phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
the restaurant|david|kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say.
the restaurant|mike|sorry david, but she really has to know this.
the restaurant|david|alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops.
the restaurant|monica|youre the most incredible woman ive ever met. how can i lose you phoebe looks very flattered now, i dont actually have a ring...
the restaurant|david|i have a ring.
the restaurant|chandler|i wouldnt brag too much about that thing, big guy.
the restaurant|david|phoebe, will you marry me
the restaurant|phoebe|smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering no
the restaurant|david|uhm... ha ha
the restaurant|phoebe|i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
the restaurant|mike|we can have any future you want. they hold their hands, gazing at each other
the restaurant|david|ok, im gonna take off.
the restaurant|phoebe|david, im so sorry, im sorry.
the restaurant|david|just so i know, if i had asked first...
the restaurant|phoebe|yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
the restaurant|david|please, you dont have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadnt gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldnt have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip he leaves
the restaurant|mike|is it ok if i hug you now
the restaurant|phoebe|yes they hug
monica and chandlers room|monica|to everybody because of our meddling alright

conference room|rachel|look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, im so jealous
conference room|ross|finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus...
conference room|chandler|to a paleontologist sitting next to him not to mention the cold sores. the paleontologist glares at chandler
conference room|ross|and thats just the herbivores. im not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development. all the paleontologists laugh
conference room|chandler|to the one sitting next to him really
conference room|ross|but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus... joey laughs
conference room|charlie|what
conference room|joey|he said erectus
conference room|charlie|youre... youre kidding, right
conference room|joey|no, he really said it.
conference room|ross|... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus... rachel laughs
