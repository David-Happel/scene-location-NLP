central perk|mike|this is nice.
central perk|phoebe|i know phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar,    shakes it, and then realises she cant open it with one hand, but doesnt want    to let go of mikes hand. she tries to tear open the packet with one hand.
central perk|mike|you need both hands for that
central perk|phoebe|yeah, i kinda do. mike lets go of her hand well,    hows this she takes mikes hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open    the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative.    after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting    on the couch, holding hands.
central perk|joey|in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice aaahhh, look    at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious phoebe and mike,    embarrassed, start babbling and look away. have you not talked about it yet    they say nothing now, but smile am i making you uncomfortable smiles are    becoming forced now, and he speaks to mike if you were bigger youd hit me,    huh... aaaaaahhhhhh he turns away to the bar
central perk|phoebe|im sorry... im sorry. its obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.
central perk|mike|is it
central perk|phoebe|in a flash she answers maybe not, is it
central perk|mike|okay, when i got divorced, i didnt think id feel this    way about someone for a really long time... then again, i didnt think id meet    someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... i want you to have    this... he tries to get something from his pocket, but its not that easy...    phoebe looks in a whats happening face to him. he finally has found    something no, not... thats gum. he digs in a little more. ooh, five bucks...    i love it when that happens, you know... think no notes there...
central perk|phoebe|impatient i know mike, why dont you keep digging
central perk|mike|oh, sorry. he digs in again and finally finds what    hes been looking for. a key.
central perk|phoebe|oh, its a key. to be honest, i think id prefer the    five dollars.
central perk|mike|its to my apartment.
central perk|phoebe|really surprised oh wow, ooh ooh, big step for    phoebe and mike.
central perk|mike|yeah, look, and i dont want you to feel like you have    to give me your key just because...
central perk|phoebe|oh no, i want to.
central perk|mike|oh, thank god. he laughs nervously, and phoebe gets    her keychain from her bag.
central perk|phoebe|yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think id never    meet someone that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go. both    phoebe and mike look really proud.
central perk|mike|is this cool, huh

monica and chandlers apartment|phoebe|no...   is pacing up and down the room.]
monica and chandlers apartment|phoebe|im... im just... im the worst person ever. how    can i not tell david that im seeing mike

monica and chandlers apartment|phoebe|sarcastically uhuh... yeah..., you know. and given    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am.
monica and chandlers apartment|monica|what are you gonna do

the hallway between the two apartments|monica|doesnt believe what shes hearing was your cabin    pressurised
the hallway between the two apartments|chandler|laughs, but then moves to phoebe and dont get    me started on the way that people from tulsa talk.
the hallway between the two apartments|phoebe|okay. and she walks away
the hallway between the two apartments|chandler|whats with the word yall you know, just... two    words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    i say why stop there you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried    chicken could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, ill have the fricken monica    laughs see, thats... thats funny with the fricken, right

the hallway between the two apartments|chandler|to phoebe were you there
ross and rachels apartment|phoebe|no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
ross and rachels apartment|sandy|i really do understand how hard its gotta be to leave    your child with another person. i mean, its leaving behind a piece of your    heart... ross has got that boredangryskeptic look and rachel is very emotional
ross and rachels apartment|rachel|sandy, thats exactly what it is...

ross and rachels apartment|ross|on a yeah, right tone okay.
ross and rachels apartment|sandy|like in my last job, i met daniel when he was three    weeks old. and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person...

ross and rachels apartment|ross|yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. in the other room    emma starts to cry.
ross and rachels apartment|rachel|oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

ross and rachels apartment|rachel|whispering and begging please ross makes a whatever    gesture yes sandy youre hired.
ross and rachels apartment|sandy|thats great he gets emotional again and waves his    hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears im    sorry. its just... such an emotional thing when youre welcomed into a new    family...
ross and rachels apartment|rachel|oooh... i really cant hear what she says come here.
joeys apartment|ross|you gotta be at least bi... commercial break   enters.]
joeys apartment|chandler|hey joey doesnt look up, but gestures wait a    minute with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits    for joey to finish. i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica    is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks.
joeys apartment|joey|ooh. ii dont know chan. im not so good with remembering    lines.
joeys apartment|chandler|cant believe what he hears well, thank god your    livelihood doesnt depend on it.

joeys apartment|joey|nooooo being funny is your thing
joeys apartment|chandler|yeah
joeys apartment|joey|without that, you just got lame with women.

joeys apartment|monica|hi there you are.
phoebes apartment|joey|sees monica fire trucks chandlers eyes double in    size and he turns to monica who doesnt understand whats happening. then he    turns back to joey, who says youre welcome without a sound   wine.]
