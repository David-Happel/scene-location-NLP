monica and chandlers apartment|monica|oh, here. she turns the tree around so that her side, which is perfectly decorated, is showing
central perk|chandler|see now it feels like christmas opening credits
central perk|ross| and thats the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago.
