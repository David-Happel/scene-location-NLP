phoebes apartment|ross|i cant believe this. not even my geology lab partner and i carried that guy gets up from his sofa
phoebes apartment|chandler|alright look, lets think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time that people are gonna post condolences on a website this is not about people not caring that youre dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
phoebes apartment|ross|youre right. there isnt a decent outlet.
phoebes apartment|chandler|right, i mean, come on, im sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
